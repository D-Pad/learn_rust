<h1>Managing Growing Projects</h1>
<p>
  We touched on this a little bit in the <strong>setup</strong> chapter. Rust 
  has a number of features that allow you to manage your code’s organization, 
  including which details are exposed, which details are private, and what 
  names are in each scope in your programs. These features are sometimes 
  collectively referred to as the <i>module system</i>, and they include
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Packages:</strong> A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, 
      and share crates
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Crates:</strong> A tree of modules that produces a library
      or an executable.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Modules</strong> and <strong>use:</strong> Let you control the 
      organization, scope, and privacy of paths.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Paths:</strong> A way of naming an item, such as a struct, 
      function, or module.
    </li>
  </ul>
  This chapter will touch a bit on these features and how to use them to 
  keep your projects clean, and maintainable.

<h2>Packages and Crates:</h2>
<h3>Crates</h3>
<div class="quote-wrapper">
  <blockquote>
    A crate is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers 
    at a time. The heirarchy looks like 
    <code class="inline-code language-rust">package &gt crate &gt module</code> 
    Even if you run rustc rather than cargo and pass a single source code 
    file (as we did all the way back in the “Writing and Running a Rust 
    Program” section of Chapter 1), the compiler considers that file to be a 
    crate. Crates can contain modules, and the modules may be defined in 
    other files that get compiled with the crate, as we’ll see in the coming 
    sections.
  </blockquote>

  </a>
</div>
<h4>Library crates</h4>
<p>
  A library crate does not contain a 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">main()</code> executable. Instead, 
  they define functionality intended to be shared with multiple projects. Like
  the <code class="inline-code">rand</code> crate, that's used to generate 
  random numbers. Most of the time, Rust programmers are referring to libraries
  when they talk about crates.
</p>
<h3>Packages</h3>
<p>
  A package is a bundle of one or more crates that provide a set of 
  functionality. A package contains a <i>Cargo.toml</i> file that describes
  how to build those crates. A package can contain as many binary crates as 
  you like, but at most only one library crate. A package must contain at 
  least one crate, whether that’s a library or binary crate. Let's walk through
  what happens when you create a new package...
</p>
<p>
  First, run the command 
  <code class="inline-code">cargo new my-package-name</code>. Running that 
  command will initialize a new package crate with a <i>Cargo.toml</i> file.
  If you inspect the contents of the crate, you'll notice that there is a 
  <i>src</i> directory, but no mention of <i>src/main.rs</i> in 
  <i>Cargo.toml</i>. Cargo follows a convention that <i>src/main.rs</i> is 
  the crate root of a binary crate with the same name as the package. Likewise, 
  Cargo knows that if the package directory contains <i>src/lib.rs</i>, the 
  package contains a library crate with the same name as the package, and 
  <i>src/lib.rs</i> is its crate root. Cargo passes the crate root files to 
  <code class="inline-code">rustc</code>
</p>
<p>
  Imagine you see a Rust package foobar with the following files:
<p>
<pre class="terminal-code"><code>foobar
├── Cargo.toml
├── build.rs
└── src/
    ├── main.rs
    ├── util.rs
    ├── lib.rs
    └── bin/
        └── alt.rs
</code></pre>
<div class="q-and-a">
  <p>
    <strong>Q:</strong> How many crates does this package contain?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A:</strong> 3
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Context:</i> <code class="inline-code">main.rs</code> produces a binary 
    crate, <code class="inline-code">lib.rs</code> produces a library crate, 
    and <code class="inline-code">bin/alt.rs</code> produces a binary crate. 
    The <code class="inline-code">util.rs</code> would presumably be used as a 
    module within one of these crates, but it is not a special filename 
    recognized by Rust, so it would not be its own crate. 
    <code class="inline-code">build.rs</code> is a build script.
  </p>
</div> 
<h2>Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy</h2>
<p>
  This section covers the <code class="inline-code language-rust">use</code> 
  keyword that brings a path into scope; and the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">pub</code> keyword to make items 
  public. We’ll also discuss the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">as</code> keyword, external packages, 
  and the glob operator. 
</p>
<h3>Modules Cheat Sheet</h3>
<ul class="cheet-sheet">
  <li>
    <strong>Start from the crate root:</strong> When compiling a crate, the 
    compiler first looks in the crate root file (usually 
    <code class="inline-code language-rust">src/lib.rs</code> for a 
    library crate or <code class="inline-code language-rust">src/main.rs</code> 
    for a binary crate) for code to compile.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Declaring modules:</strong> In the crate root file, you can 
    declare new modules; say you declare a “garden” module with mod garden. 
    The compiler will look for the module’s code in these places:
  </li>
  <ul> 
    <li>
      Inline, within curly brackets that replace the semicolon following mod 
      garden
    </li>
    <li>
      In the file <code class="inline-code">src/garden.rs</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      In the file <code class="inline-code">src/garden/mod.rs</code>
    </li>
  </ul> 
  <li>
    <strong>Declaring submodules:</strong> In any file other than the crate 
    root, you can declare submodules. For example, you might declare mod 
    vegetables; in <code class="inline-code">src/garden.rs</code>. The 
    compiler will look for the submodule’s code within the directory named 
    for the parent module in these places:
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Inline, directly following 
      <code class="inline-code">mod vegetables</code>, within curly brackets 
      instead of the semicolon
    </li>
    <li>
      In the file <code class="inline-code">src/garden/vegetables.rs</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      In the file <code class="inline-code">src/garden/vegetables/mod.rs</code>
    </li>
  </ul> 
  <li>
    <strong>Paths to code in modules:</strong> Once a module is part of your 
    crate, you can refer to code in that module from anywhere else in that 
    same crate, as long as the privacy rules allow, using the path to the code. 
    For example, an Asparagus type in the garden vegetables module would be 
    found at 
    <code class="inline-code language-rust">
      crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus
    </code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Private vs. public:</strong> Code within a module is private from 
    its parent modules by default. To make a module public, declare it with 
    <code class="inline-code">pub mod</code> instead of 
    <code class="inline-code">mod</code>. To make items within a public 
    module public as well, use <code class="inline-code">pub</code> before 
    their declarations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The use keyword:</strong> Within a scope, the 
    <code class="inline-code">use</code> keyword creates shortcuts to items 
    to reduce repetition of long paths. In any scope that can refer to 
    <code class="inline-code language-rust">
      crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus
    </code>, you can create a shortcut with use 
    <code class="inline-code language-rust">
      crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus
    </code>; and from then on you only need to write Asparagus to make use of 
    that type in the scope.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Sample Module</h3>
<pre class="terminal-code"><code>backyard
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    ├── garden
    │   └── vegetables.rs
    ├── garden.rs
    └── main.rs
</code></pre>
<p>
  The crate root file in this case is src/main.rs, and it contains:
</p>

<h6 class="file-name">/src/main.rs</h6>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus;

pub mod garden;

fn main() {
    let plant = Asparagus {};
    println!("I'm growing {plant:?}!");
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  The <code class="inline-code language-rust">pub mod garden</code>; line 
  tells the compiler to include the code it finds in <i>src/garden.rs</i>, 
  which is: 
</p>
<h6 class="file-name">src/garden.rs</h6>
<code class="inline-code language-rust">pub mod vegetables</code>
<p>
  Here, <code class="inline-code">pub mod vegetables;</code> 
  means the code in <i>src/garden/vegetables.rs</i> is included too. That 
  code is: 
</p>
<h6 class="file-name">src/garden/vegetables.rs</h6>
<pre><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Asparagus {}
</code></pre>

<h3>Grouping Related Code in Modules</h3>
<p>
  Earlier, we mentioned that <i>src/main.rs</i> and <i>src/lib.rs</i> are 
  called crate roots. The reason for their name is that the contents of 
  either of these two files form a module named <strong>crate</strong> at the 
  root of the crate’s module structure, known as the module tree. This means
  that you can use the keyword 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">crate</code> at the start of a path,
  such as the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">
    crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus
  </code> example from above. 
</p>
<h3>The Super Keyword</h3>
<p>
  You can use the keyword <code class="inline-code language-rust">super</code>
  to refer to a the top level module in a module hierarchy. Lets use the 
  following module as an example.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn deliver_order() {}

mod back_of_house {
    fn fix_incorrect_order() {
        cook_order();
        super::deliver_order();
    }

    fn cook_order() {}
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  The <code class="inline-code">fix_incorrect_order</code> function is in the 
  <code class="inline-code">back_of_house</code> module, so we can use 
  <code class="inline-code">super</code> to go to the parent module of 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">back_of_house</code>, which in this 
  case is crate, the root. From there, we look for 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">deliver_order</code> and find it.
</p>
<h3>Privacy with Structs and Enums:</h3>
<h4>Struct Privacy</h4>
<p>
  Making a <code class="inline-code language-rust">struct</code> public, in 
  the context of a module, is 
  much different than making an 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">enum</code> public. Making a 
  <strong>struct</strong> public doesn't effect the attributes of the struct. 
  In fact, all of the attributes are private by default, even if the struct 
  itself if public. You need to specify the attributes as public as well:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">mod person_mod {

    pub struct Person {
        pub name: String,
        age: u8
    }
    
    impl Person {
        pub fn new(name: String, age: u8) -> Self {
            Self {name, age} 
        }
    }
}

pub fn run() {
    use person_mod::Person; 
    let me: Person = person_mod::Person::new(
        String::from("dpad"),
        34
    ); 
    println!("{}", me.name);
    // println!("{}", me.age);   This line won't compile
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  Just as a demonstration, notice how it's legal to access a private attribute 
  of a struct if the struct is defined in the same module as the code that's 
  trying to access it private attributes.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8
}

fn run() {
    let me: Person = Person {
        name: String::from("dpad"),
        age:34 
    };
    println!("Name and age: {} | {}", me.name, me.age);
}
</code></pre>
<h4>Enum Privacy</h4>
<p>
  By contrast, if you make an enum public within a module, the enum and all 
  of it's variants are public. The code below compiles just fine.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">mod back_of_house {
    pub enum Appetizer {
        Soup,
        Salad,
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    let order1 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Soup;
    let order2 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Salad;
}
</code></pre>
<h2>The use keyword</h2>
<p>
  Take a look at the code block below. 
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">mod restaurant {
    pub mod kitchen {
        pub fn cook_burgers(how_many: u8) {
            println!("Cooking {how_many} burgers");
        } 
    }
}

pub fn run() {
    restaurant::kitchen::cook_burgers(2); 
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  It would get repetetive and verbose to write out 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">
    restaurant::kitchen::cook_burgers(1);</code> every time we want to use the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">cook_burgers()</code> function. 
  Instead, we could bring the cook_burgers function into scope with the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">use</code> keyword like so:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">mod restaurant {
    pub mod kitchen {
        pub fn cook_burgers(how_many: u8) {
            println!("Cooking {how_many} burgers");
        } 
    }
}

pub fn run() {
    use restaurant::kitchen::cook_burgers; 
    cook_burgers(2); 
    cook_burgers(4); 
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  But, bringing the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">cook_burgers()</code> function into 
  scope isn't an idiomatic way of doing thigs. Instead, it's better to stop at 
  <code class="inline-code">kitchen</code>. This helps to differentiate 
  functions within specific modules, or even functions defined in the file 
  you're working on.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">mod restaurant {
    pub mod kitchen {
        pub fn cook_burgers(how_many: u8) {
            println!("Cooking {how_many} burgers");
        } 
    }
}

pub mod gas_station {
   
    pub mod store {
        pub fn buy_gatorade() {
            println!("Buying gatorade");
        }
    }

    pub fn pump_gas(gallons: u8) {
        println!("Pumping {gallons}");
    }
}

fn place_order() {}

pub fn run() {
    
    use restaurant::kitchen; 
    use gas_station::store; 
    
    // The origins of these functions are clear. 
    store::buy_gatorade(); 
    kitchen::cook_burgers(2); 
    place_order();
}
</code></pre>

<div class="quote-wrapper">
  <blockquote>
    <p> 
      On the other hand, when bringing in structs, enums, and other items 
      with use, it’s idiomatic to specify the full path. Listing 7-14 shows 
      the idiomatic way to bring the standard library’s HashMap struct into 
      the scope of a binary crate.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Filename: src/main.rs</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-rust">use std::collections::HashMap;
    
    fn main() {
        let mut map = HashMap::new();
        map.insert(1, 2);
    }
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      There’s no strong reason behind this idiom: it’s just the convention 
      that has emerged, and folks have gotten used to reading and writing 
      Rust code this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exception to this idiom is if we’re bringing two items with the 
      same name into scope with use statements, because Rust doesn’t allow 
      that. Listing 7-15 shows how to bring two Result types into scope that 
      have the same name but different parent modules, and how to refer to 
      them.
    </p>

    <h3>Filename: src/lib.rs</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-rust">use std::fmt;
use std::io;

fn function1() -> fmt::Result {
    // --snip--
}

fn function2() -> io::Result<()> {
    // --snip--
}</code></pre>

    -- The book: Chapter 7.4 
  </a>
</div>
<h3>The as keyword</h3>
<p>
  Another solution to the problem we just discussed, is to alias the items 
  that you're bringing into scope, with the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">as</code> keyword.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::fmt;
use std::io as IoResult;

fn function1() -> Result {
    // --snip--
}

fn function2() -> IoResult<()> {
    // --snip--
}</code></pre>
<h3>Bring multiple items from same module into scope</h3>
<p>
  Sometimes you may want to use multiple modules from the same parent module. 
  Rather than writing multiple <strong>use</strong> statements on several 
  lines, you can use curely braces as a shorthand. The two code 
  blocks below are functionaly identical.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::cmp::Ordering;
use std::io;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};
</code></pre>
<p>
  So are these...
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::io;
use std::io::Write;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::io::{self, Write};
</code></pre>
<div class="quote-wrapper">
  <blockquote>
    <h3>The Glob Operator</h3>
    <p>   
      If we want to bring all public items defined in a path into scope, we 
      can specify that path followed by the * glob operator:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-rust">use std::collections::*;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      This use statement brings all public items defined in std::collections 
      into the current scope. Be careful when using the glob operator! Glob 
      can make it harder to tell what names are in scope and where a name 
      used in your program was defined.
