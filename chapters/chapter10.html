<h1>Generics, Traits, and Lifetimes</h1>
<h2>Generics</h2>
<p>
  As the title suggests, this chapter will cover generic types, traits, and 
  lifetimes. According to the book, every programming language has it's own 
  way of managing the duplication of concepts. In Rust, one of these methods
  are called <i>generics</i>: abstract stand-ins for concrete types or other
  properties. We can express the behavior of generics without knowing what will
  be in their place at compile time. You've already seen generics in previous
  chapters, such as <code class="inline-code">Vec&ltT&gt</code>,
  <code class="inline-code">Option&ltT&gt</code>, 
  <code class="inline-code">HashMap&ltK, V&gt</code>, and 
  <code class="inline-code">Result&ltT, E&gt</code>. This 
  chapter will explain how to make your own generics
</p>
<p>
  Generics can help remove code duplication by allowing us to substitute one
  of several different types as input parameters. For example, imagine you
  have a function that looks for the largest number in a list:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn largest_i32(list: &[i32]) -> &i32 {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  If you wanted to then use this function to find the largest value in a list 
  of <code class="inline-code">char</code> types, then you'd need another 
  function, with the exact same body, but with a different input parameter 
  type (<code class="inline-code">list: &[char]</code>), and a different 
  return type. Here is what that function signature would look like.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn largest_char(list: &[char]) -> &char {
</code></pre>
<p>
  When we use a parameter in the body of a function, we have to declare it in 
  the function signature. Similarly, when using generic types in a function
  body, we have to declare the generic types in 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">&lt&gt</code> brackets. Here's what 
  the signature of the function above would look like if it were rewritten with 
  generic types.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
</code></pre>
<p>
  That alone, is not enough, however. The function signature would throw a 
  compiler error. Below is an explanation on why that would happen.
</p>
<div class="quote-wrapper">
  <blockquote>
     <p> 
      The issue above is that when largest takes a slice 
      <code class="inline-code">&amp[T]</code> as input, the 
      function cannot assume anything about the type 
      <code class="inline-code">T</code>. It could be 
      <code class="inline-code">i32</code>, it could be 
      <code class="inline-code">String</code>, it could be 
      <code class="inline-code">File</code>. However, largest 
      requires that <code class="inline-code">T</code> is something you can 
      compare with <code class="inline-code">&gt</code> (i.e. that 
      <code class="inline-code">T</code> implements 
      <code class="inline-code">PartialOrd</code>, a trait which we will 
      discuss in the next section). Some types like 
      <code class="inline-code">i32</code> and 
      <code class="inline-code">String</code> are comparable, but other types 
      like <code class="inline-code">File</code> are not comparable.
    </p>
    <p> 
      In a language like C++ with templates, the compiler would not complain 
      about the implementation of largest, but instead it would complain 
      about trying to call largest on e.g. a file slice 
      <code class="inline-code">&[File]</code>. Rust instead requires you to 
      state the expected capabilities of generic types up front. If 
      <code class="inline-code">T</code> needs to be comparable, then largest 
      must say so. Therefore this compiler error says largest will not 
      compile until <code class="inline-code">T</code> is restricted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, unlike languages like Java where all objects have a set 
      of core methods like 
      <code class="inline-code">Object.toString()</code>, there are no core 
      methods in Rust. Without restrictions, a generic type 
      <code class="inline-code">T</code> has no capabilities: it cannot be 
      printed, cloned, or mutated (although it can be dropped).
    </p>

<h2>Generics in Struct Definitions</h2>
<p>
  We cand define structs to use a generic type parameter in one or more fields 
  using the <code class="inline-code">&lt&gt</code> syntax. Notice how the two
  point structs in the <code class="inline-code language-rust">main()</code>
  function use different data types (int and float) for their coordinates.
  This is only possible because of the generic types used in the Struct 
  definition.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  Using a single generic type is fine for the example above, but if you expect 
  mixed types, then you need to provide more generic parameters.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">struct Point&ltT&gt {
    x: T,
    y: T
}


// Using a combination of data types requires the 
// use of multiple generic types in the signature 
struct ComboPoint&ltT, U&gt {
    x: T,
    y: U
}


pub fn run() {
    let integer = Point { x: 5, y: 7 };
    let floats = Point { x: 1.2, y: 3.14 };
    let combo = ComboPoint { x: 2, y: 5.3 };
    let not_combo = ComboPoint { x: 1, y: 1 }; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  Generics can be used in enums, and method definitions as well.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">struct Point&ltT&gt {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl&ltT&gt Point&ltT&gt {
    fn x(&ampself) -> &ampT {
        &ampself.x
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Traits</h2>
<p>
  A <i>trait</i> defines the functionality that a particular type has, and can 
  share that funcionality with other types. <i>Traits</i> are used to to 
  define shared behaviour in an abstract way.
</p>
<p>
  When defining a trait, you don't define it's behavior. All types that 
  implement this trait must define their own behaviors for that trait. 
  A trait can have multiple methods in its body: the method signatures are 
  listed one per line, and each line ends in a semicolon. The compiler will 
  enforce all types with the Summary trait to provide their own methods with 
  the exact same signature.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">trait PersonTitle {
    fn get_title(&self) -&gt String; 
}


struct Civilian {
    name: String
}

impl PersonTitle for Civilian {
    fn get_title(&ampself) -&gt String {
        let mut title: String = String::from("Mr. ");
        title.push_str(&ampself.name);
        title
    }
}


struct Doctor {
    name: String
}

impl PersonTitle for Doctor {
    fn get_title(&ampself) -&gt String {
        let mut title: String = String::from("Dr. ");
        title.push_str(&ampself.name);
        title
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  Implementing a trait is almost identical to implementing methods normal 
  methods, except you have to use the <code class="inline-code">for</code>
  keyword after the name of the trait, to identify the 
  <code class="inline-code">struct</code> or 
  <code class="inline-code">enum</code> that you're implementing the trait on.
</p>
<h3>Default Implementations</h3>
<p>
  It's also possible to define a default behavior for a trait instead of
  requiring an explicit implementation.
