<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This document is my own place to take notes, and record thoughts. I'm not 
  writing this with the intention of sharing it with anyone else, but if 
  you're not me, and you find yourself reading this, know that I won't be 
  citing any sources, and much of the content in this document is going 
  to be useful information that I've copied and pasted from online.
</p>

<p>
  Most of the content is going to come directly out of the official book, 
  which is freely available on any machine that has rust installed on it.
  There's also a nice interactive version with quizes in it
