<h1>Enums and Pattern Matching</h1>
<h2>Enums</h2>
<p>
  Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible variants. Where 
  structs give you a way of grouping together related fields and data, like a 
  Rectangle with its width and height, enums give you a way of saying a value 
  is one of a possible set of values. This seems like a good way of passing an 
  'object' (for lack of a better term) that could be one of many types, as an 
  function argument. For example, we may want to say that Rectangle is one of 
  a set of possible shapes that also includes Circle and Triangle. To do this, 
  Rust allows us to encode these possibilities as an enum.
</p>
<p>
  Assume we're working with IP addresses. IP's can only be IPv4, or IPv6. Any 
  IP address can be either a version four or a version six address, but not 
  both at the same time. That property of IP addresses makes the enum data 
  structure appropriate because an enum value can only be one of its variants. 
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">enum IpAddrKind {
    V4(String),
    V6(String),
}

fn main() {
  let four = IpAddrKind::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));
  let six = IpAddrKind::V6(String::from("::1"));
}
</code></pre>

<h2>The match Control Flow Construct</h2>
<p> 
  Rust has an extremely powerful control flow construct called 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">match</code> that allows you to 
  compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code based on 
  which pattern matches. Patterns can be made up of literal values, variable 
  names, wildcards, and many other things. Chapter 18 covers all the 
  different kinds of patterns and what they do. The power of match comes from 
  the expressiveness of the patterns and the fact that the compiler confirms 
  that all possible cases are handled.

  <blockquote cite="https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch06-02-match.html">
    Think of a <code class="inline-code">match</code> expression as being like 
    a coin-sorting machine: coins slide down a track with variously sized holes 
    along it, and each coin falls through the first hole it encounters that it 
    fits into. In the same way, values go through each pattern in a match, and 
    at the first pattern the value “fits,” the value falls into the associated 
    code block to be used during execution.

  Let's look at some samples of enums. Below, is an example of a 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">Coin</code> enum. Back in the day, 
  the US released 4 quarters with state symbols minted onto them, every year. 
  Our source code also contains an enum for US States, that we can use to 
  further classify a 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">Coin::Quarter</code> enum
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Debug)]
enum UsState {
    Alabama,
    Alaska,
    Arizona,
    Arkansas,
    California,
    Colorodo,
    Conneticut
}

enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter(UsState)
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => {
            println!("Lucky penny");
            1
        }
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter(state) => {
            println!("State quarter from {state:?}!");
            25
        }
    }
}

pub fn run() {
    let coin: Coin = Coin::Quarter(UsState::Arkansas);
    println!("Value: {}", value_in_cents(coin));
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  The quote from the book below, gives an execellent break down of the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">match</code> keyword, and the 
  components that make up the whole statement.
</p>
<div class="quote-wrapper">
  <blockquote>
    <p> 
      Let’s break down the <code class="inline-code language-rust">match</code> 
      in the <code class="inline-code language-rust">value_in_cents()</code> 
      function. First we list the 
      <code class="inline-code language-rust">match</code> keyword followed by 
      an expression, which in this case is the value coin. This seems very 
      similar to a conditional expression used with 
      <code class="inline-code language-rust">if</code>, but there’s a big 
      difference: with <code class="inline-code language-rust">if</code>, the 
      condition needs to evaluate to a 
      <code class="inline-code language-rust">bool</code> value, but here it 
      can be any type. The type of coin in this example is the Coin enum that 
      we defined on the first line. 
    </p>
    <p> 
      Next are the <code class="inline-code language-rust">match</code> arms. 
      An arm has two parts: a pattern and some code. The first arm here has a 
      pattern that is the value 
      <code class="inline-code language-rust">Coin::Penny</code> and then the 
      <code class="inline-code">=></code> operator that separates the pattern 
      and the code to run. The code in this case is just the value 1. Each arm 
      is separated from the next with a comma. 
    </p>

<h2>Matching with Option&ltt&gt</h2>
<p>
  Rust has a built in enum that's so common, that you don't even have to 
  import it from a module. It's called 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">Option</code> and it's used to 
  describe a value that can either be <i>something</i> or <i>nothing</i>. The 
  types are <code class="inline-code language-rust">Some</code> or 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">None</code>. Let’s say we want to 
  write a function that takes an 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">Option&lti32&gt</code> and, if 
  there’s a value inside, adds 1 to that value. If there isn’t a value inside,
  the function should return the None value and not attempt to perform any 
  operations.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
    match x {
        None => None,
        Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
    }
}

let five = Some(5);
let six = plus_one(five);
let none = plus_one(None);
</code></pre>
<p>
  An important thing to note about enums, is that the arms' patterns must cover
  all possibilities. The code below will not compile, because we have not 
  covered the <code class="inline-code language-rust">None</code> case.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
    match x {
        Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
        // WILL NOT COMPILE. 'None' IS NOT HANDLED 
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  This behaviour means that matches in Rust are <i>exhaustive</i>. They must 
  <i>exhaust</i> all possibilites.
</p>
<h2>Catch-all Patterns and the _ Placeholder</h2>
<p>
  You can also use an enum to take action for a few particular values, and 
  something else for all other values. You can name the last variable anything
  you want. The sample below uses a variable named 
  <code class="inline-code">other</code> to handle any value other than 3 or 5.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use rand::Rng;


pub fn dice_rolling() {
   
    // Generate a random number
    let roll_value: u8 = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=5); 
   
    // Check the value for a win, or death condition
    match roll_value {
        3 => explode_player(),
        5 => reward_player(),
        other => retry(other) 
    }

    // Arm functions
    fn retry(val: u8) {
        println!("You rolled {val}. Try again!");
    }

    fn explode_player() {
        println!("You're dead!");
    }

    fn reward_player() {
       println!("You win!"); 
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  This code compiles, even though we haven’t listed all the possible values a 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">u8</code> can have, because the 
  last pattern will match all values not specifically listed. 
</p>
<h3>Using _</h3>
<p>
  Sometimes you may need a placeholder value, but you don't actually want to 
  use the value. That's where <code class="inline-code">_</code> comes in. The 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">match</code> case above could be 
  rewritten as:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">    match roll_value {
        3 => explode_player(),
        5 => reward_player(),
        _ => println!("Try again!") 
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
  If you don't want to do anything at all with the <strong>catch-all</strong>,
  you can use the <i>unit value</i> <code class="inline-code">()</code>.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">    match roll_value {
        3 => explode_player(),
        5 => reward_player(),
        _ => () 
    }
</code></pre>

<h2>Ownership and Matching</h2>
<p>
  Be careful when matching a value, if you end up using the value. The code 
  below won't compile because of the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">println!()</code> statement at the 
  bottom.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let opt: String = String::from("Hello world");

match opt {
    Some(s) => println!("{s}"),  // Ownership moved here
    None => println!("None")
}
println!("{opt}");  // Won't compile because opt has been freed from memory
</code></pre>
<p>
  The solution here is to borrow <code class="inline-code">opt</code> in the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">match</code> statement.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let opt: String = String::from("Hello world");

// Borrow opt
match &ampopt {
    Some(s) => println!("{s}"),  // 's' is of type &ampString
    None => println!("None")
}
println!("{opt}"); 
</code></pre>
<div class="quote-wrapper">
  <blockquote>
    Rust will “push down” the reference from the outer enum, 
    <code class="inline-code language-rust">&ampOption&ltString&gt</code>, to 
    the inner field, <code class="inline-code language-rust">&ampString</code>.
    Therefore <code class="inline-code">s</code> has type 
    <code class="language-rust inline-code ">&ampString</code>, and 
    <code class="inline-code">opt</code> can be used after the match. To 
    better understand this “pushing down” mechanism, see the section about 
    binding modes in the Rust Reference.

<h2>Concise Control Flow with 'if let'</h2>
<p>
  The if let syntax lets you combine if and let into a less verbose way to 
  handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest. When using
  an enum and a <code class="inline-code language-rust">match</code> 
  statement, you may find yourself needing match a single pattern, while
  ignoring everything else. You can use the 
  <code class="inline-code">_ =&gt ()</code> syntax, but that is 
  unnecessary boilerplate, and would make your code more verbose than it has 
  to be. A better way to write this would be to use the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">if let</code> syntax.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let config_max = Some(3u8);
if let Some(max) = config_max {
    println!("The maximum is configured to be {max}");
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  The syntax if let takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal 
  sign. It works the same way as a match, where the expression is given to 
  the match and the pattern is its first arm. In this case, the pattern is 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">Some(max)</code>, and the max binds 
  to the value inside the <code class="inline-code language-rust">Some</code>.
</p>
<div class="quote-wrapper">
  <blockquote>
    Using <code class="inline-code language-rust">if let</code> means less 
    typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate code. However, you lose 
    the exhaustive checking that match enforces. Choosing between match and 
    if let depends on what you’re doing in your particular situation and 
    whether gaining conciseness is an appropriate trade-off for losing 
    exhaustive checking.
