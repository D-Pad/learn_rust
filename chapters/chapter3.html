<h1>Variable Declarations and Types</h1>
<p>
  This chapter covers many basic computer science concepts, but in the context 
  of Rust.
</p>

<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>
  Declaring variables in Rust requires type annotations in most cases. Some
  values have default types, like an integer having a default i32 type, in case 
  no type is defined. It is possible to assign an expression to a value also, 
  including code blocks. You do this the same way as returning a value from a 
  function, which is to omit the semi colon on the last line of the expression.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let x: i32 = {
    let a: i32 = 12;
    let b: i32 = 10;
    a + b
};
</code></pre>

<h2>Mutability</h2>
<p>
  All variables in Rust are immutable by default. If you want a variable to be 
  mutable, you must explicitly state so using the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">mut</code> keyword:
<pre><code class="language-rust">let mut x: u8 = 10;
mut += 5;
</code></pre>
  Without the mut keyword, the code above wouldn't compile. Even though values
  in Rust are immutable by default, you can still declare a value and assign a 
  value to it on a later line.

<pre><code class="language-rust">let x;
let cond: bool = false;
if cond { x = 1; } else  { x = 2; }
println!("X: {}", x);
x = 3; // THIS LINE WON'T COMPILE, x HAS BEEN ASSIGNED ALREADY
</code></pre>
  Even though <code class="inline-code">x</code> was declared as immutable, no 
  value was assigned right away, so we can still assign a value later on.
</p>

<h2>Constants</h2>
<p>
  Constants are similar to immutable variables, except constants are known are
  known at <i>compile-time</i> where immutable variables are known at 
  <i>run-time</i>. You cannot use the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">mut</code> keyword with a constant. 
  Stylistically, constants should be declared with names in all caps. 
  Constants also require a type annotation, there is no default type such as 
  <strong>i32</strong> for integer variables.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let x;
const Y: i32 = 9000;
</code></pre>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>
  Declared variables are accessible in a lower scope, but variables declared
  in the lower scope are discarded at the end of the next code block, and no 
  longer accessible.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let outer_scope: &ampstr = &ampString::from("OUTER SCOPE");
let recipient: String;
let border: &ampstr = &ampString::from("\n  --------------------");
{
    recipient = String::from("INNER SCOPE");
    let inner_scope: &ampstr = &amprecipient;
    println!("\n  TO:   {}{}\n    {}\n    -- {}\n {}", 
        outer_scope, 
        border,
        String::from("Happy birthday"), 
        inner_scope, 
        border
    );
}
// 'inner_scope' is no longer accessible from here, but since we 
// modified 'recipient', we can return a message to the original sender.
println!("\n  TO:   {}{}\n    {}\n    -- {}\n {}", 
    recipient, 
    border, 
    String::from("Thank you"), 
    outer_scope, 
    border . 
);
</code></pre>

<h3>Scalar Types and Primitive Types</h3>
<p>
A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: 
integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters. Before diving
into types, it's worth mentioning that values can sometimes be type cast
on assignment just by giving a type annotation.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let life: u8 = "42".trim().parse().expect("Not a number");
</code></pre>

<p>
  You can write long chains like the example above on multiple lines, like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let life: u8 = "42"
    .trim()
    .parse()
    .expect("Not a number");
</code></pre>

<h4>Integers</h4>
<p>
  Rust has signed (+ and -) and unsigned (+ only) integer types of different 
  sizes:
</p>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Length</th><th>Signed</th><th>Unsigned</th>
    </tr> 
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>8-bit</td><td>i8</td><td>u8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>16-bit</td><td>i16</td><td>u16</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>32-bit</td><td>i32</td><td>u32</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>64-bit</td><td>i64</td><td>u64</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>128-bit</td><td>i128</td><td>u128</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>arch</td><td>isize</td><td>usize</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  Integer types can be declared like so:
<pre><code class="language-rust">let x: i32 = -42;
let y: u8 = 64;
</code></pre>
</p>

<h4>Floating point values</h4>
<p>
  Floating point values are declared as f32 and f64
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let small: f32 = 3.14;
let large: f64 = 1.23424987234;
</code></pre>

<p>
  Number literals can be represented in other formats by writing them as
  they appear in the table below.
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Number literals</th><th>Example</th>
    </tr> 
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Decimal</td><td>98_222</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hex</td><td>0xff</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Octal</td><td>0o77</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Binary</td><td>0b1111_0000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Byte (u8 only)</td><td>b'A'</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Booleans</h4>
<p>
  Not much needs to be said here
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let little_said: bool = true; 
</code></pre>

<h4>Characters</h4>
<p>
  Character types are quite simple compared to strings in Rust. They
  <strong>must</strong> be declared with single quotes. 
  <code class="inline-code">'a'</code> is valid, but 
  <code class="inline-code">"a"</code> is not, because
  <code class="inline-code">"a"</code> is a <i>String literal</i>
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let initial: char = 'D'; 
println!("  My initials start with {}", initial);
</code></pre>

<p>
  Note that we specify char literals with single quotes, as opposed to string 
  literals, which use double quotes. Rust’s char type is four bytes in size and 
  represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more 
  than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; 
  emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid char values in Rust. Unicode
  Scalar Values range from 
  <code class="inline-code">U+0000</code> to 
  <code class="inline-code">U+D7FF</code> and 
  <code class="inline-code">U+E000</code> to 
  <code class="inline-code">U+10FFFF</code> 
  inclusive. 
</p>

<h4>Mutable</h4>
<p>
  All data types are <i>immutable</i> by default, in Rust. You must use the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">mut</code> keyword when declaring a 
  variable in order to make it a mutable value.
</p>


<pre><code class="language-rust">let mut day_of_week: String = String::from("Tuesday");
day_of_week = String::from("Wednesday");
</code></pre>

<h3>Compound Types</h3>
<p>
  Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive
  compound types: tuples and arrays.
</p>

<h4>Arrays</h4>
<p>
  Arrays in rust are homogenous, and have a fixed lengths. All elements of the 
  array must be of the same type. When an array is declared with annotations, 
  you must pass 2 parameters into the annotation. The first one is the 
  <i>data type</i>, and the second one is the length of the array.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">// Integer array
let num_arr: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
println!("Some numbers: {:?}", num_arr);

// String array
let fruit: [&ampstr; 3] =  ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];
println!("Some fruit: {:?}", fruit); 
println!("I like {}s, but can't stand {}s", fruit[2], fruit[0]);
</code></pre>

<p>
  You can also initialize an array to contain the same value for each element 
  by specifying the initial value, followed by a semicolon, and then the length
  of the array in square brackets, as shown here:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let a = [3; 5];
</code></pre>

<p>
  Arrays are only useful when the length of the array is known. They can offer
  a performance increase since they're stack-allocated. If you need something
  that isn't fixed-length, then you may need to look at the heap-allocated
  type, Vector.
</p>

<h4>Tuples</h4> 
<p>
  Tuples in rust are declared with (), and can be of mixed types. A tuple is a 
  general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types 
  into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they 
  cannot grow or shrink in size.

  The tuple without any values has a special name, known as 
  <strong>unit</strong>. This value and its corresponding type are both written
  () and represent an empty value or an empty return type. Expressions 
  implicitly return the unit value if they don’t return any other value.
  
  We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside 
  parentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the 
  different values in the tuple don’t have to be the same. We’ve added optional 
  type annotations in this example: 
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let a = [3; 5];
let vals: (String, u8, f32) = ("D-Pad", 34, 5.8);
</code></pre>

<p>
  Type elements can be access with the dot operator and a numerical value. 
  Weird syntax, honestly. 
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let name: String = vals.0;
let age: u8: vals.1;
let bmi: f64 = vals.2;
</code></pre>

<p>
  Here's a more verbose example...
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let biped_1 = ("Alice", 30, false);
let biped_2: (String, i32, bool) = ("Zorb".to_string(), 184, true);

println!("  Human: {:?}\n  Alien: {:?}", biped_1, biped_2);
if biped_2.2 != biped_1.2 {
    println!("  {} was abducted by {}", biped_1.0, biped_2.0);
} else {
    println!("  {} and {} are good pals.", biped_1.0, biped_2.0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>
  Any data type can be stored in a tuple, including other complex types 
  like arrays.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">// A 2D structure of arrays in a tuple  
let two_dee: ([&ampstr; 3], [u8; 3]) = (
    ["D-Pad", "Chase", "Steve"], 
    [13, 21, 34]
);
println!("  2D structure: {:?}", two_dee);
</code></pre>

<p>
  To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to 
  destructure a tuple value, like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
let (x, y, z) = tup;
println!("The value of y is: {y}");
</code></pre>

<p>
  Additionally, we can modify individual elements of a mutable tuple. 
  For example:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let mut x: (i32, i32) = (1, 2);
x.0 = 0;
x.1 += 5;
</code></pre>

<h4>Slices</h4>
<p>
  Slices are a dynamically sliced view, of a contiguous sequence of 
  elements. A 'contiguous sequence' refers to a series of elements 
  placed together in a continuous order without any gaps in between. 
  It is a pattern used to organize data where elements are stored 
  consecutively in memory.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">// Array slices are declared the same way 
// as a string slice (&ampstr)
let my_slice: &amp[i32] = &amp[1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let animals: &amp[&ampstr] = &amp["Lion", "Elephant"];
let books: &amp[&ampString] = &amp[
    &amp"Harry Potter".to_string(), 
    &amp"Outsiders".to_string()
];
</code></pre>

<h4>String types</h4>
<p>
  There are two types of strings in Rust. One of them is modifiable in all of 
  the ways that you'd expect a string to behave in high-level languages like 
  Python and Javascript, while the other is more like a constant string with 
  a fixed size. 
</p>

<p>
  Using the <code class="inline-code language-rust">str</code> type as a 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">String</code> reference is so common,
  that you will often see people refer to 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">String</code> and 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">&ampstr</code> as the two string 
  types in Rust, when in reality, both strings types can be referenced (
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">&ampString</code> and 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">&ampstr</code>). When you make a 
  reference with <code class="inline-code language-rust">&ampString</code>, 
  you're taking a reference to the regular String type, which retains all of 
  the attributes of <code class="inline-code language-rust">String</code> 
  even though the reference is immutable. This is why it makes more sense to 
  just use <code class="inline-code language-rust">&ampstr</code> when 
  referencing strings, as the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">str</code> is much more light-weight.
</p>

<p>
  The two types can be used interchangeably.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">fn log_this(msg: &ampstr) {
    println!("Message: {}", msg);
}

fn main() {
    let err_message: String = String::from("ERROR: Oh no!");
    log_this(&amperr_message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>
  Notice how the string was declared as type
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">String</code>, but it was passed into 
  a function that requires type 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">&ampstr</code>, as 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">&amperr_message</code>. The Rust 
  compiler knows what you mean and allows this to happen. In general, it's 
  best to use <strong>&ampstr</strong> over <strong>&ampString</strong> as 
  function argumentsbecause <strong>&ampstr</strong> is lighter.
</p>

<h4>String</h4>
<p>
  Strings are mutable, growable, owned string types that are 
  <strong>heap-allocated</strong>.
  Being heap allocated is what makes them more flexible, at the cost of 
  performance. 
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let reinhardt: String = String::from("For the Crusaders!");  
println!("Reinhardt says: {}", reinhardt);
</code></pre>

<p>
  You can concatonate strings by using the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">push_str()</code> method on a 
  String type.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">// String
let mut reinhardt: String = String::from("Hammer");  
reinhardt.push_str(" DOWN!");
println!("Reinhardt says: {}", reinhardt);
</code></pre>

<strong>More examples:</strong>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let string = String::from("127.0.0.1:8080"); 
let string_slice = &ampstring[10..]; 
let string_borrow: &ampstr = &ampstring; 
let string_literal = "1234"; 
</code></pre>

<h5>String slices: str</h5>
<p>
  Unlike a <strong>String</strong> type, the <strong>str</strong> type is a 
  <strong>stack-allocated</strong>, fixed size
  string type. In fact, when a string is defined as 
  <code class="inline-code">str</code>, it's hard coded into the data section 
  of the compiled binary. 
</p>

<p> 
  A string-slice is not a String. It is a <i>reference</i> to a string that is 
  stored somewhere in memory. You should use a string-slice when you want to 
  work with string data, without taking ownership of it. This is good for 
  memory efficiency, because you do not have to store a copy of a string 
  somewhere else in memory. In the example below, we create a String object, 
  and a u8 object, with the intention of constructing a new string out of them.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">// String-slice
let mut ticker_symbol: String = String::from("ESM");
let year: u8 = 24;
</code></pre>

<p>
  A few things need to happen in order to append a value of type 
  <strong>u8</strong> as characters onto an existing string. We need to call 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">push_str()</code> on the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">ticker_symbol</code> object, which 
  requires an input of type <strong>&ampstr</strong>. The 
  <code class="inline-code">year</code> 
  object is of type <strong>u8</strong>, which has a 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">to_string()</code> method, but that 
  method returns a <strong>String</strong> object. In order to get the 
  appropriate input data type, we can simply borrow a reference to the 
  <strong>String</strong> that we're creating. Since that string object isn't 
  used anywhere else, it's discarded after it's been created, and referenced.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">// Create a string with year.to_string(), then reference it.
ticker_symbol.push_str(&ampyear.to_string());

// Create a new string reference to the newly modified ticker_symbol
let ticker_slice: &ampstr = &ampticker_symbol;
println!("Ticker symbol: {}", ticker_slice);
</code></pre>

<h5>Indexed string slices</h5> 
<p>
  You can reference particular slices of a string with 
  <code class="inline-code">[n..n]</code> syntax.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let asset_id: &ampstr = &ampticker_symbol[0..2];
</code></pre>

<h2>Shadowing</h2>
<p>
  Shadowing allows you to assign a new value to an existing variable name, but
  this does not drop the value of the first variable. It simply changes which 
  value the variable name is referencing.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let x: i32 = 25;
let y: &ampi32 = &ampx;
let x: i32 = 74;
println!("X: {}\nY: {}", x, y);
</code></pre>

<p>
  In this example, we can keep the value of x from being changed, but we can't 
  keep what the name x refers to from being changed. Here's another example of 
  shadowing.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let spaces = "    ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
</code></pre>

<p>
  First, we assign the value of <code class="inline-code">"    "</code> to s
  paces, then we shadow a new variables named spaces, that's assigned an 
  integer value equal to the length of the first 
  <code class="inline-code">spaces</code> variable.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = 'ℤ'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = '😻';
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Functions</h2>
<p> 
  Functions in Rust are declared with the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">fn</code> keyword. Each function 
  argument must be annotated, and a return type must be declared with 
  <code class="inline-code">-></code>. Notice how the last line of the 
  <code class="inline-code">add</code> function from the example below, doesn't 
  have a semicolon at the end of the line. That's because this is the way to 
  return a value from a function in Rust. You omit the semicolon, and the value 
  on that line will be returned.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">// Declaring a function with a return type of u8
fn add(num_1: u8, num_2: u8) -> u8 {
    num_1 + num_2 
}

pub fn main() {
    // Call the add function and display output
    let num_1: u8 = 10;
    let num_2: u8 = 12;
    let total: u8 = add(num_1, num_2);
    println!("Total: {}", total);
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  You can return early from a function by using the return keyword and 
  specifying a value, but most functions return the last expression implicitly. 
  Here’s an example of a function that returns a value:
</p>
<h3>Hoisting</h3>
<p>
  Function hoisting is supported in Rust, which means that you can safely call 
  a function on lines of code above the functions definitions. Such as calling
  the <code class="inline-code language-rust">add()</code> function within 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">main()</code> even though 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">add()</code> isn't defined first.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    add(3, 5);
}

fn add(x: u8, y: u8) -> u8 {
    x + y 
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Statements and Expressions</h2>
<p> 
  Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an 
  expression. So far, the functions we’ve covered haven’t included an ending 
  expression, but you have seen an expression as part of a statement. Because 
  Rust is an expression-based language, this is an important distinction to 
  understand. Other languages don’t have the same distinctions, so let’s look 
  at what statements and expressions are and how their differences affect the 
  bodies of functions.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a 
      value.
    </li>
    <li>
      Expressions evaluate to a resultant value.
    </li>
  </ul> 
</p>
<p> 
  Expressions evaluate to a value and make up most of the rest of the code that 
  you’ll write in Rust. Consider a math operation, such as 5 + 6, which is an 
  expression that evaluates to the value 11. Expressions can be part of 
  statements: in Listing 3-1, the 6 in the statement let y = 6; is an expression 
  that evaluates to the value 6. Calling a function is an expression. Calling a 
  macro is an expression. A new scope block created with curly brackets is an 
  expression, for example:
</p>

<h2>Control Flow</h2>
<h3>if Expressions</h3>
<p>
  An if expression allows you to branch your code depending on conditions. 
  You provide a condition and then state, “If this condition is met, run this 
  block of code. If the condition is not met, do not run this block of code.”
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let number = 3;
if number < 5 {
    println!("condition was true");
} else {
    println!("condition was false");
}
</code></pre>

<p>
  If expressions require a <strong>boolean</strong>. Rust doesn't implicitly 
  convert values booleans like some languages do, which means you can't do 
  things like:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let x = 23;
if x {  // This line won't compile
    run_some_code();
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Repetition with Loops</h3>
<p>
  There are 3 different kinds of loops in Rust. 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">loop</code>, 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">while</code>, and 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">for</code>. Obviously <i>loop</i> is 
  kind of an outlier here. While and for exist in basically every other 
  language.
</p>

<h4>loop</h4>
<p>
  The loop keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again 
  forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop. 
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let target: u8 = 10;
let mut count: u8 = 0;
loop {
    if count == target {
        break
    }
    count += 1;
}
</code></pre>
<p> 
  One of the uses of a loop is to retry an operation you know might fail, such 
  as checking whether a thread has completed its job. You might also need to 
  pass the result of that operation out of the loop to the rest of your code. 
  To do this, you can add the value you want returned after the break
  expression you use to stop the loop; that value will be returned out of the 
  loop so you can use it, as shown here:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let mut counter = 0;
let result = loop {
    counter += 1;

    if counter == 10 {
        break counter * 2;
    }
};
println!("The result is {result}");
</code></pre>
<p>
  You can also return from inside a loop. While break only exits the current 
  loop, return always exits the current function.
</p>
<h5>Loop Labels to Disambiguate Between Multiple Loops</h5>
<p>
  If you have loops within loops, break and continue apply to the innermost loop 
  at that point. You can optionally specify a loop label on a loop that you can 
  then use with break or continue to specify that those keywords apply to the 
  labeled loop instead of the innermost loop. Loop labels must begin with a 
  single quote. Here’s an example with two nested loops:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let mut count = 0;
'counting_up: loop {
    println!("count = {count}");
    let mut remaining = 10;

    loop {
        println!("remaining = {remaining}");
        if remaining == 9 {
            break;
        }
        if count == 2 {
            break 'counting_up;
        }
        remaining -= 1;
    }

    count += 1;
}
println!("End count = {count}");
</code></pre>
<p>
  The outer loop has the label 'counting_up, and it will count up from 0 to 2. 
  The inner loop without a label counts down from 10 to 9. The first break that 
  doesn’t specify a label will exit the inner loop only. The 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">break 'counting_up</code> 
  statement will exit the outer loop.

<h4>while</h4>
<p>
  You know how these work.. Syntax:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let mut number = 3;
while number != 0 {
    println!("{number}!");
    number -= 1;
}
println!("Lift off!");
</code></pre>

<h4>for</h4>
<p>
  These work intuitively, like you'd expect in Python.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let arr: [u8; 4] = [10,  20, 30, 40];
for num in arr {
    println!("Number: {num}");
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  The safety and conciseness of for loops make them the most commonly used loop 
  construct in Rust. Even in situations in which you want to run some code a 
  certain number of times, as in the countdown example that used a while loop in 
  Listing 3-3, most Rustaceans would use a for loop. The way to do that would be 
  to use a Range, provided by the standard library, which generates all numbers 
  in sequence starting from one number and ending before another number.
</p>
<p>
  Here’s what the countdown would look like using a for loop and another 
  method we’ve not yet talked about, <code class="inline-code">rev</code>, to 
  reverse the range:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">for number in (1..4).rev() {
    println!("{number}!");
}
println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
</code></pre>
