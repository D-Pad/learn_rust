<h2>Infallable Type</h2>
<p>
  Infallable is an enum with no ways to instantiate it, which isn't ordinarily
  allowed. It is sometimes used as the return value of a function that can 
  never return.

<pre><code class="language-rust">pub enum Infallible {}
</code></pre>

  Useful for functions that run in an infinite loop, like an HTTP server.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn t_1000() -> Infallible {
    loop {
        seek_humans();
        kill_humans();
    }
}
</code></pre>
