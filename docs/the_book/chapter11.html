<h1>Writing Automated Tests</h1>
<p>
  Rust supports writing automated tests for testing program correctness. 
</p>
<h3>How to Write Tests</h3>
<div class="quote-wrapper">
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Tests are Rust functions that verify that the non-test code is 
      functioning in the expected manner. The bodies of test functions 
      typically perform these three actions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Set up any needed data or state.</li>
      <li>Run the code you want to test.</li>
      <li>Assert that the results are what you expect.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Let’s look at the features Rust provides specifically for writing tests 
      that take these actions, which include the test attribute, a few macros, 
      and the should_panic attribute.

<h3>The Anatomy of a Test Function</h3>
<div class="quote-wrapper">
  <blockquote>
    At its simplest, a test in Rust is a function that’s annotated with the 
    test attribute. Attributes are metadata about pieces of Rust code; one 
    example is the derive attribute we used with structs in Chapter 5. To 
    change a function into a test function, add #[test] on the line before fn. 
    When you run your tests with the cargo test command, Rust builds a test 
    runner binary that runs the annotated functions and reports on whether 
    each test function passes or fails.

<p>
  The source code block at the bottom of this page demonstrates how to create 
  a unit test, and run it. Notice how the 
  <code class="inline-code">it_works()</code> function has the 
  <code class="inline-code">#[test]</code> line above the function signature.
  Running <code class="inline-code">cargo test</code> will automatically run
  the functions defined with that macro.
</p>
<p>
  Running <code class="inline-code">cargo test</code> will run all test 
  functions with the <code class="inline-code">#[test]</code> macro, but what 
  if you only want to run certain tests? This is also possible, and is known 
  as <i>filtering</i>, but we'll talk about that later.
</p>
<h3>Adding Custom Failure Messages</h3>
<p>
  You can add custom failure messages by adding a string as a second argument
  to the <code class="inline-code language-rust">assert!</code> macro.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">#[test]
fn greeting_contains_name() {
    let result = greeting("Carol");
    assert!(
        result.contains("Carol"),
        "Greeting did not contain name, value was `{result}`"
    );
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Checking for Panics with should_panic</h3>
<p>
  Sometimes you expect that a test should fail. If a test panics, and that's 
  what you want, then you need to use the 
  <code class="inline-code">#[should_panic]</code> macro.
</p>


<pre><code class="language-rust">fn adder(num_1: i32, num_2: i32) -&gt i32 {
    num_1 + num_2
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        let output = adder(2, 2);    
        assert_eq!(output, 4); 
    }
}

pub fn run() {
    println!("-- Auto Test Modules --");
    println!("Run 'cargo test' to get the intended output of this module")
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Controlling How Tests are Run</h2>
<div class="quote-wrapper">
  <blockquote>
    <p> 
      Just as cargo run compiles your code and then runs the resultant binary, 
      cargo test compiles your code in test mode and runs the resultant test 
      binary. The default behavior of the binary produced by cargo test is to 
      run all the tests in parallel and capture output generated during test 
      runs, preventing the output from being displayed and making it easier to 
      read the output related to the test results. You can, however, specify 
      command line options to change this default behavior. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Some command line options go to cargo test, and some go to the 
      resultant test binary. To separate these two types of arguments, you 
      list the arguments that go to cargo test followed by the separator 
      <code class="inline-code">--</code> and then the ones that go to the 
      test binary. Running <code class="inline-code">cargo test --help</code> 
      displays the options you can use with cargo test, and running 
      <code class="inline-code">cargo test -- --help</code> displays the 
      options you can use after the separator. 
    </p>
