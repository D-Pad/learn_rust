<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This document is my own place to take notes, and record thoughts. I'm not 
  writing this with the intention of sharing it with anyone else, but if 
  you're not me, and you find yourself reading this, know that I won't be 
  citing any sources, and much of the content in this document is going 
  to be useful information that I've copied and pasted from online.

<h2>Resources</h2>
<h3>The book</h3>
<p>
  Most of the content is going to come directly out of the official book, 
  which is freely available on any machine that has rust installed on it.
  There's also a nice interactive version with quizes in it

<h3>The Rustonomicon</h3>
<p>
  Rust is praised for it's memory safety, but sometimes you might need more 
  control over your code than the borrow checker will allow. For information 
  on <strong>unsafe Rust</strong>, go
