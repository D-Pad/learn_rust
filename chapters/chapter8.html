<h1>Common Collections</h1>
<p>
  This section will discuss the standard library's 
  <strong>common collections</strong>. A powerful module with some common 
  <i>collection</i> types such as <i>vectors</i>. Arrays and tuples are 
  stack allocated, but the types you'll find in the collections module are
  heap allocated. This makes them growable, but less performant. 
</p>
<h2>Vectors</h2>
<p>
  The first collection we'll talk about, are vectors. Written as 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">Vec&ltT&gt</code>
</p>
<h3>Creating a New Vector</h3>
<p>
  To create a new empty vector, we call the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">Vec::new</code> function, as shown
  below
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let v: Vec&lti32&gt = Vec::new();
</code></pre>
<p>
  Some notes on Vectors and their stored data types:
</p>
<div class="quote-wrapper">
  <blockquote cite="https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch06-02-match.html">
    Note that we added a type annotation here. Because we aren’t inserting any 
    values into this vector, Rust doesn’t know what kind of elements we intend 
    to store. This is an important point. Vectors are implemented using 
    generics. The Vec&ltT&gt type provided by the standard library 
    can hold any type. When we create a vector to hold a specific type, we can 
    specify the type within angle brackets. In the code block above we’ve 
    told Rust that the Vec&ltT&gt in v will hold elements of the i32 type. 
    More often, you’ll create a Vec&ltT&gt with initial values and Rust will 
    infer the type of value you want to store, so you rarely need to do this 
    type annotation. Rust conveniently provides the vec! macro, which will 
    create a new vector that holds the values you give it. Listing 8-2 
    creates a new Vec&lti32&gt that holds the values 1, 2, and 3. The integer 
    type is i32 because that’s the default integer type, as we discussed 
    in the “Data Types” section of Chapter 3.
    <pre><code class="language-rust">let v = vec![1, 2, 3];</code></pre>

  </a>
</div> 
<h4>Adding Elements to a Vector</h4>
<p>
  Vectors can have new values inserted into it with the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">push()</code> method. 
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">pub fn run() {
    let mut v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
    v.push(1);
    v.push(2);
    v.push(3);
    println!("Easy as {:?}", v);
}
</code></pre>
<h4>Reading Values from a Vector</h4>
<p>
  Vectors have 2 ways of referencing their values. Either from indexing, or by 
  using the <code class="inline-code language-rust">get()</code> method.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let third: &i32 = &v[2];
println!("The third element is {third}");

let third: Option<&i32> = v.get(2);
match third {
    Some(third) => println!("The third element is {third}"),
    None => println!("There is no third element."),
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  However, these two methods are not created equally. When indexing, if you 
  us an invalid index value, such as indexing the 10th item of a vector with 
  only 3 items, then your program will crash. Conversely, using the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">get()</code> method won't cause 
  a panic.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let does_not_exist = &v[100];      // This line causes a panic
let does_not_exist = v.get(100);   // This line does not   
</code></pre>
<p>
  You can use this to your advantage when writing programs. Sometimes you may
  want the program to crash on an indexing error. Other times you may want to 
  use <code class="inline-code language-rust">get()</code> and return 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">None</code>
</p>

<h3>Iterating Through a Vector</h3>
<p>
  You can (and probably should) loop through each item in a Vector rather than 
  having to loop for <i>X</i> times and reference by index.
</p> 
<pre><code class="language-rust">let v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for n_ref in &v {
    // n_ref has type &i32
    let n_plus_one: i32 = *n_ref + 1;
    println!("{n_plus_one}");
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  Notice how we had to use the <code class="inline-code">*</code> dereference 
  operator before we could add a 1 to it. We can also iterate over mutable 
  references to each element in a mutable vector in order to make changes to 
  all the elements. The for loop in below will add 50 to each element.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for n_ref in &mut v {
    // n_ref has type &mut i32
    *n_ref += 50;
}
</code></pre>

<h5>Vector Demo Source Code</h5>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let mut people: Vec&ltString&gt = Vec::new();
people.push(String::from("chad"));
people.push(String::from("brad"));

println!("{:?}", people);
println!("winner = {}", people[0]); 
println!("loser = {}", people[1]); 
</code></pre>

<h3>Safely Using Iterators</h3>
<p>
  Iterators will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter. For now, an 
  important note to make is that 
  <strong>iterators contain a pointer to data within the vector</strong>. For 
  more information, and a helpful diagram, go 
  <a href="https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch08-01-vectors.html#safely-using-iterators">
    here
  </a>
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let mut v: Vec&lti32&gt         = vec![1, 2];
let mut iter: Iter&lt'_, i32&gt = v.iter();
let n1: &ampi32                = iter.next().unwrap();
let n2: &ampi32                = iter.next().unwrap();
let end: Option&lt&ampi32&gt       = iter.next();
</code></pre>
<p>
  The iterator in the code block above is a pointer that moves through each 
  element of the vector. When the iterator runs through the vector, it will 
  either return an instance of <code class="inline-code language-rust">
    Some
  </code> or <code class="inline-code language-rust">None</code>, when the 
  iterator reaches the end of the vector.
</p>
<p>
  Rust's safety rules prohibit modifying the length of a Vector while iterating
  through it. If you need to iterator over a Vector, and modify it, then you 
  can use a range to loop through the index values of the vector.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let mut v: Vec&lti32&gt        = vec![1, 2];
let mut iter: Range&ltusize&gt = 0 .. v.len();
let i1: usize              = iter.next().unwrap();
let n1: &ampi32               = &ampv[i1];
</code></pre>

<h3>Using an Enum to Store Multiple Types</h3>
<p>
  Vectors can only store a single data type, but sometimes it's quite useful
  to store elements of different types, like lists in Python. In Rust, you can 
  use an enum for this. Take a look at the code block below. This defines 
  an enum that can hold 3 different data types. We then use the enum to create
  rows in a spreadsheet.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">enum SpreadsheetCell {
    Int(i32),
    Float(f64),
    Text(String),
}

let row = vec![
    SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
    SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from("blue")),
    SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
];
</code></pre>
<p>
  If you don’t know the exhaustive set of types a program will get at runtime 
  to store in a vector, the enum technique won’t work. Instead, you can use a 
  trait object, which we’ll cover in Chapter 18. For more information on 
  mixing data types with enums, read

<h2>Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text With Strings</h2>
<p>
  Strings in Rust are quite complicated compared to other programming 
  languages. Having multiple string types is one of the main reasons for this,
  but UTF-8 encoding is another reason that working with Strings can be 
  challenging. We're talking about strings in this chapter on 
  <strong>collections</strong> because 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">String</code> types are a collection
  of bytes, that are interpreted as UTF-8 encoded text.
</p>
<p>
  There is actually only one string type in the Rust's core language, and that
  is the <code class="inline-code language-rust">str</code> (string slice)
  type. String slices are actually hard coded into the binary file when a 
  program is compiled. The 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">String</code> type, on the other 
  hand, is a part of the <strong>Rust standard library</strong>. Not a part 
  of the core language itself, and it is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 
  encoded string type. Both <code class="inline-code language-rust">str</code>
  and <code class="inline-code language-rust">String</code> types are UTF-8 
  encoded.
</p>
<p>
  String literals (<code class="inline-code language-rust">str</code>) are 
  hard coded into the binary file by the compiler. You can actually see them 
  if you view the compiled file in a text editor. This is why you have to use
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">&ampstr</code> when declaring a 
  string slice variable. The text that you write between double quotes is 
  written into the binary file by the compiler, and you're borrowing a 
  reference of it. The 'literal' variable below demonstrates this. Even the 
  string literals that you see in the 'hello' and 'world' declarations are 
  compiled as <code class="inline-code language-rust">str</code> types.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let literal: &ampstr = "Literally a string";
let hello: String = String::from("Hello");
let world: String = "world!".to_string();
println!("{hello} {world}");
</code></pre>
<p>
  As stated in the paragraph above, you can see the string literals in the 
  binary, if you want. Compiling the code snip above and viewing the contents
  of the binary file in a text editor may reveal something like:
</p>
<code class="inline-code">^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@Literally a stringHelloworld!
</code>
<p>
  This works when compiling on Linux, and viewing the binary file in Neovim.
</p>
<h3>Updating Strings</h3>
<h4>push_str() and push()</h4>
<p>
  There are a few ways to insert new values into a string, just like you can 
  do to a Vector. One common way is to use the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">push_str()</code> method. This method
  takes a string slice <code class="inline-code language-rust">&ampstr</code>,
  because we don't necessarily want the method to take ownership of the string.

</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let mut s1 = String::from("foo");
let s2 = "bar";
s1.push_str(s2);
println!("s2 is {s2}");
</code></pre>
<p>
  In the code snip above, if 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">push_str()</code> took ownership of
  the string, then it would be discarded after the operation, and the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">println!</code> statement wouldn't 
  be able to access <code class="inline-code">s2</code>.
</p>
<p>
  If you ever need to push a single character onto a string, then you should
  use the <code class="inline-code language-rust">push()</code> method. 
  Remember, that single characters are defined in single quotes, like 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">'A'</code>.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let mut s = String::from("lo");
s.push('l');
</code></pre>
<h4>Concatonating with + and the format! Macro</h4>
<p>
  Sometimes you may want to combine 2 strings together. You can do this with 
  the <code class="inline-code">+</code> operator. Doing this will perform a 
  move, and you will lose access to one of the string values. You also need
  to use a string slice on the right side of the operator. This is because 
  using <code class="inline-code">+</code> calls the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">add()</code> method, and the 
  signature of <code class="inline-code language-rust">add()</code> looks like
  this: 
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn add(self, s: &str) -> String {
</code></pre>
<p>
  The code snippet below demonstrates the use of the 
  <code class="inline-code">+</code> operator. In the example, we're combining
  a reference to <code class="inline-code">s2</code> 
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
let s2 = String::from("world!");
let s3 = s1 + &amps2; // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
</code></pre>
<p>
  Using several <code class="inline-code">+</code> operators could get ugly.
  The following line looks confusing, and hard to read because of the 
  combination of plus signs and double quotes. 
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let s = s1 + "-" + &amps2 + "-" + &amps3;
</code></pre>
<p>
  A solution is to use the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">format!</code> macro to combine 
  strings. It works the same way as the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">println!</code> macro.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let s1 = String::from("tic");
let s2 = String::from("tac");
let s3 = String::from("toe");

let s = format!("{s1}-{s2}-{s3}");
</code></pre>
<p>
  That looks much cleaner than the previous method, using multiple plus signs.
</p>

<h3>Indexing into strings</h3>
<p>
  Unlike many other programming languages, Rust does not support indexing into
  strings with brackets. The line of code below is invalid.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let s1 = String::from("hello");
let h = s1[0];  // This line throws a compiler error
</code></pre>
<pre class="terminal-code"><code>$ cargo run

</code></pre>
<p>
  This happens because the way that 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">String</code> types are implemented 
  in Rust. A <code class="inline-code language-rust">String</code> type is just
  a wrapper around a <code class="inline-code language-rust">Vec&ltu8&gt</code>
</p>
<div class="quote-wrapper">
  <blockquote>
    A String is a wrapper over a Vec&ltu8&gt. Let’s look at some of our 
    properly encoded UTF-8 example strings from Listing 8-14. First, this one:
    <pre><code class="language-rust">let hello = String::from("Hola");</code></pre>
    In this case, len will be 4, which means the vector storing the string "
    Hola" is 4 bytes long. Each of these letters takes one byte when encoded 
    in UTF-8. The following line, however, may surprise you (note that this 
    string begins with the capital Cyrillic letter Ze, not the number 3):
<pre><code class="language-rust">let hello = String::from("Здравствуйте");</code></pre>
    If you were asked how long the string is, you might say 12. In fact, Rust’s
    answer is 24: that’s the number of bytes it takes to encode 
    “Здравствуйте” in UTF-8, because each Unicode scalar value in that string 
    takes 2 bytes of storage. Therefore, an index into the string’s bytes 
    will not always correlate to a valid Unicode scalar value. To demonstrate, 
    consider this invalid Rust code:
    <pre><code class="language-rust">let hello = "Здравствуйте";
let answer = &hello[0];
    </code></pre>
    You already know that answer will not be З, the first letter. When 
    encoded in UTF-8, the first byte of З is 208 and the second is 151, so it 
    would seem that answer should in fact be 208, but 208 is not a valid 
    character on its own. Returning 208 is likely not what a user would want 
    if they asked for the first letter of this string; however, that’s the 
    only data that Rust has at byte index 0. Users generally don’t want the 
    byte value returned, even if the string contains only Latin letters: if 
    &amp"hello"[0] were valid code that returned the byte value, it would 
    return 104, not h.

</div>
<p>
  Indexing into a string is a bad idea because it's not clear what the return 
  type of the string-indexing is. Rather than indexing with 
  <code class="inline-code">[]</code> and a single number, you can provide a 
  range with <code class="inline-code">..</code>. Like the example below
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let hello = "Здравствуйте";
let s = &amphello[0..4];
</code></pre>

<h5>String Demo Source Code</h5>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let mut name: String = String::from("");

// Add a single character
name.push('_');

// Add a number to the username
let num: u8 = 29;
name.push_str(&ampformat!("{num}")); 

// Slice a string 
let original: &ampstr = &ampname[0..4];

// Display the user name, the hard way.
// This demonstrates how to iterate through a string
for (i, c) in name.chars().enumerate() {
    print!("{c}");
    if i == name.len() - 1 {
        println!();
    }
}
</code></pre>


<h2>Hash Maps</h2>
<p>
  Hash maps in Rust are used to store key-value pairs, like a Javascript
  object, or a Python dictionary. Although it's not nearly as simple as that.
  One way to create an empty hash map is to use the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">new()</code> method, then create it's 
  values with the <code class="inline-code language-rust">insert()</code> 
  method. Note that the hash maps are not included in the prelude, like 
  vectors and strings are. They aren't as common, and therefore not included 
  by default. You myst include it with 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">use</code>
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);
</code></pre>
<p>
  Hash maps are homogeneous. All keys must be the same type, and all of the 
  values must be the same time. The keys do not need to be the same time as 
  values, however.
</p>

<h3>Accessing Values in a Hash Map</h3>
<p>
  We can fetch values of a hash map by calling the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">get()</code> method. 
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

let team_name = String::from("Blue");
let score = scores.get(&ampteam_name).copied().unwrap_or(0);
</code></pre>
<h3>Hash Map Ownership</h3>
<p>
  For types that implement the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">Copy</code> trait, like 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">i32</code>, the values are copied 
  into the hash map. For owned values like 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">String</code>, the values will be 
  moved and the hash map will be the owner of those values.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::collections::HashMap;

let field_name = String::from("Favorite color");
let field_value = String::from("Blue");

let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert(field_name, field_value);
// println!("{field_name} {field_value}");  &lt- This line won't compile
</code></pre>
<h4>Overwriting a Value</h4>
<p>
  You can also use <code class="inline-code language-rust">insert()</code>
  to overwrite values in a hash map.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 25);

println!("{scores:?}");
</code></pre>

<h4>Adding a Key and Value Only If a Key Isn't Present</h4>
<p>
  Sometimes you don't want to modify a value if it already exists. Hash maps
  have a special method called <code class="inline-code">entry</code> that 
  takes the key you want to check as a parameter. The return type is an 
  enum called <code class="inline-code">Entry</code> that represents a value
  that might or might not exist. The <code class="inline-code">Entry</code> 
  enum has a method called <code class="inline-code">or_insert</code>, which 
  is defined to return a mutable reference to the value for the corresponding
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">Entry</code> key, if that key exists,
  and if not, it inserts the parameter as the new value for this key and 
  returns a mutable reference to the new value. 
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();
scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);

scores.entry(String::from("Yellow")).or_insert(50);
scores.entry(String::from("Blue")).or_insert(50);

println!("{scores:?}");
</code></pre>
<h4>Updating a Value Based on the Old Value</h4>
<p>
  The code below splits the string literal by whitespace, then loops through 
  each word, stores the word in a hash map as a key if it doesn't already
  exist, and if it does exist, then the value is incremented up.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::collections::HashMap;

let text = "hello world wonderful world";

let mut map = HashMap::new();

for word in text.split_whitespace() {
    let count = map.entry(word).or_insert(0);
    *count += 1;
}

println!("{map:?}");
</code></pre>

<div class="quote-wrapper">

    <h3>Hashing Functions</h3>
    By default, HashMap uses a hashing function called SipHash that can 
    provide resistance to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks involving hash 
    tables1. This is not the fastest hashing algorithm available, but the 
    trade-off for better security that comes with the drop in performance is 
    worth it. If you profile your code and find that the default hash 
    function is too slow for your purposes, you can switch to another 
    function by specifying a different hasher. A hasher is a type that 
    implements the BuildHasher trait. We’ll talk about traits and how to 
    implement them in Chapter 10. You don’t necessarily have to implement 
    your own hasher from scratch; crates.io has libraries shared by other 
    Rust users that provide hashers implementing many common hashing 
    algorithms.
