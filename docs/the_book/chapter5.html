<h1>Structs</h1>
<p>
  Structs are comparable to Tuples in the sense that they can both hold 
  multiple relatable values. The main difference is that a struct can name 
  it's values. To define a struct, simply use the 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">struct</code> keyword
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  To use a struct, you have to provide values for all fields.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  Mutable structs can have their attributes modified by directly accessing the 
  attribute with dot notation, and reassigning.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">user1.email = String::from("dpad@dpadllc.com");
</code></pre>

<h2>Field init shorthand syntax</h2>
<p>
  When writing a function that takes in arguments and returns a struct, you will
  often run into cases where the function arguments are the same names as the 
  struct attributes. To avoid having a ton of arguments, you can use field init 
  shorthand syntax.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn build_new_user(email: String, name: String) -> User {
    let user1 = User {
        active: true,
        email,
        name 
    };
    user1
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  Notice how we didn't have to write 
  <code class="inline-code">email: email</code> or 
  <code class="inline-code">name: name</code> in that function. That's field 
  init shorthand syntax.
</p>
<h2>Struct update syntax</h2>
<p>
  You can easily create an instance of a struct from another instance using 
  struct update syntax.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let user2 = User {
    active: false,
    ..user1
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Tuple Structs</h2>
<p>
  Tuple structs are like structs, but the fields aren't named. 
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0)5
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Unit-like structs without fields</h2>
<p>
  You can also define structs that don’t have any fields. These are called unit-
  like structs because they behave similarly to (), the unit type that we 
  mentioned in “The Tuple Type” section. Unit-like structs can be useful when 
  you need to implement a trait on some type but don’t have any data that you 
  want to store in the type itself.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">struct AlwaysEqual;

fn main() {
    let subject = AlwaysEqual;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Displaying struct data</h2>
<p>
  By default, structs do not implent Display or Debug traits, which is needed 
  in order to display the structs data. You can either manually implement them, 
  or you can inheret them using 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">#[derive(Debug)]</code> syntax.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">#[derive(Debug)]
struct User {
    name: String,
    email: String,
    age: u8
}

pub fn main() {
    let user = User {
        name: String::from("D-Pad"),
        email: String::from("dpad@dpadllc.com"),
        age: 34 
    }
    println!("{:?}", user);
}
</code></pre>
<p> 
  Doing this will print all of the struct attributes on one line. To get a 
  cleaner output on multiple lines, you can use 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">"{:#?}"</code>
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">println!("{:#?}", user);
</code></pre>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p> 
  Methods are just functions that are defined within the context of a struct. 
  To add methods, use the <code class="inline-code language-rust">impl</code> 
  keyword.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">impl User {
    fn greet(&self) {
        println!("Hello, my name is {}", self.name); 
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  Struct methods in Rust are just syntactical sugar for functions. The method
  call and function call below are exactly the same.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let mut rect_a = Rectangle { 
    width: 10,
    height: 4 
};

// These are the same
rect_a.rotate();
Rectangle::rotate(&mut rect_a);
</code></pre>
