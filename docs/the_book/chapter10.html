<h1>Generics, Traits, and Lifetimes</h1>
<h2>Generics</h2>
<p>
  As the title suggests, this chapter will cover generic types, traits, and 
  lifetimes. According to the book, every programming language has it's own 
  way of managing the duplication of concepts. In Rust, one of these methods
  are called <i>generics</i>: abstract stand-ins for concrete types or other
  properties. We can express the behavior of generics without knowing what will
  be in their place at compile time. You've already seen generics in previous
  chapters, such as <code class="inline-code">Vec&ltT&gt</code>,
  <code class="inline-code">Option&ltT&gt</code>, 
  <code class="inline-code">HashMap&ltK, V&gt</code>, and 
  <code class="inline-code">Result&ltT, E&gt</code>. This 
  chapter will explain how to make your own generics
</p>
<p>
  Generics can help remove code duplication by allowing us to substitute one
  of several different types as input parameters. For example, imagine you
  have a function that looks for the largest number in a list:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn largest_i32(list: &[i32]) -> &i32 {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  If you wanted to then use this function to find the largest value in a list 
  of <code class="inline-code">char</code> types, then you'd need another 
  function, with the exact same body, but with a different input parameter 
  type (<code class="inline-code">list: &[char]</code>), and a different 
  return type. Here is what that function signature would look like.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn largest_char(list: &[char]) -> &char {
</code></pre>
<p>
  When we use a parameter in the body of a function, we have to declare it in 
  the function signature. Similarly, when using generic types in a function
  body, we have to declare the generic types in 
  <code class="inline-code language-rust">&lt&gt</code> brackets. Here's what 
  the signature of the function above would look like if it were rewritten with 
  generic types.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
</code></pre>
<p>
  That alone, is not enough, however. The function signature would throw a 
  compiler error. Below is an explanation on why that would happen.
</p>
<div class="quote-wrapper">
  <blockquote>
     <p> 
      The issue above is that when largest takes a slice 
      <code class="inline-code">&amp[T]</code> as input, the 
      function cannot assume anything about the type 
      <code class="inline-code">T</code>. It could be 
      <code class="inline-code">i32</code>, it could be 
      <code class="inline-code">String</code>, it could be 
      <code class="inline-code">File</code>. However, largest 
      requires that <code class="inline-code">T</code> is something you can 
      compare with <code class="inline-code">&gt</code> (i.e. that 
      <code class="inline-code">T</code> implements 
      <code class="inline-code">PartialOrd</code>, a trait which we will 
      discuss in the next section). Some types like 
      <code class="inline-code">i32</code> and 
      <code class="inline-code">String</code> are comparable, but other types 
      like <code class="inline-code">File</code> are not comparable.
    </p>
    <p> 
      In a language like C++ with templates, the compiler would not complain 
      about the implementation of largest, but instead it would complain 
      about trying to call largest on e.g. a file slice 
      <code class="inline-code">&[File]</code>. Rust instead requires you to 
      state the expected capabilities of generic types up front. If 
      <code class="inline-code">T</code> needs to be comparable, then largest 
      must say so. Therefore this compiler error says largest will not 
      compile until <code class="inline-code">T</code> is restricted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, unlike languages like Java where all objects have a set 
      of core methods like 
      <code class="inline-code">Object.toString()</code>, there are no core 
      methods in Rust. Without restrictions, a generic type 
      <code class="inline-code">T</code> has no capabilities: it cannot be 
      printed, cloned, or mutated (although it can be dropped).
    </p>

<h2>Generics in Struct Definitions</h2>
<p>
  We cand define structs to use a generic type parameter in one or more fields 
  using the <code class="inline-code">&lt&gt</code> syntax. Notice how the two
  point structs in the <code class="inline-code language-rust">main()</code>
  function use different data types (int and float) for their coordinates.
  This is only possible because of the generic types used in the Struct 
  definition.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  Using a single generic type is fine for the example above, but if you expect 
  mixed types, then you need to provide more generic parameters.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">struct Point&ltT&gt {
    x: T,
    y: T
}


// Using a combination of data types requires the 
// use of multiple generic types in the signature 
struct ComboPoint&ltT, U&gt {
    x: T,
    y: U
}


pub fn run() {
    let integer = Point { x: 5, y: 7 };
    let floats = Point { x: 1.2, y: 3.14 };
    let combo = ComboPoint { x: 2, y: 5.3 };
    let not_combo = ComboPoint { x: 1, y: 1 }; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  Generics can be used in enums, and method definitions as well.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">struct Point&ltT&gt {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl&ltT&gt Point&ltT&gt {
    fn x(&ampself) -> &ampT {
        &ampself.x
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Traits</h2>
<p>
  A <i>trait</i> defines the functionality that a particular type has, and can 
  share that funcionality with other types. <i>Traits</i> are used to 
  define shared behaviour in an abstract way. A type’s behavior consists of 
  the methods we can call on that type. Different types share the same 
  behavior if we can call the same methods on all of those types. 
</p>
<p>
  When defining a trait, you don't define it's behavior. All types that 
  implement this trait must define their own behaviors for that trait. 
  A trait can have multiple methods in its body: the method signatures are 
  listed one per line, and each line ends in a semicolon. The compiler will 
  enforce all types with the Summary trait to provide their own methods with 
  the exact same signature.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">trait PersonTitle {
    fn get_title(&self) -&gt String; 
}


struct Civilian {
    name: String
}

impl PersonTitle for Civilian {
    fn get_title(&ampself) -&gt String {
        let mut title: String = String::from("Mr. ");
        title.push_str(&ampself.name);
        title
    }
}


struct Doctor {
    name: String
}

impl PersonTitle for Doctor {
    fn get_title(&ampself) -&gt String {
        let mut title: String = String::from("Dr. ");
        title.push_str(&ampself.name);
        title
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  Implementing a trait is almost identical to implementing methods normal 
  methods, except you have to use the <code class="inline-code">for</code>
  keyword after the name of the trait, to identify the 
  <code class="inline-code">struct</code> or 
  <code class="inline-code">enum</code> that you're implementing the trait on.
</p>
<h3>Default Implementations</h3>
<p>
  It's also possible to define a default behavior for a trait instead of
  requiring an explicit implementation for each type that implements the 
  trait. Defining a default behaviors are as simple as adding a code block 
  after the trait sigature.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">trait PersonTitle {
    fn get_title(&self) -&gt String {
        String::from("Default string")
    }; 
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Traits as parameters</h2>
<p>
  Traits are used to define functions that can accept many different types
  as input parameters.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">pub fn notify(item: &impl Summary) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  The function above will work with any type that implements the Summary 
  trait. Instead of defining the input parameter as some specific data type,
  we set the type as <code class="inline-code">&ampimpl Summary</code>. This
  means that we can pass in any data type that implements the Summary 
  <i>trait</i>. The syntax in the code block above works, but it's just 
  syntax sugar for a long form known as a <i>trait bound</i>. 
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">pub fn notify&ltT: Summary&gt(item: &ampT) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  This longer form is equivalent to the example in the previous section but 
  is more verbose. We place trait bounds with the declaration of the generic 
  type parameter after a colon and inside angle brackets. The shorter syntax 
  may seem like the obvious choice to make, but the more verbose syntax can 
  end up being less verbose if there are more input parameters. Look at the 
  two samples below, then imagine an function signature with 4 or 5 inputs.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">pub fn notify(item1: &ampimpl Summary, item2: &ampimpl Summary) {}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-rust">pub fn notify&ltT: Summary&gt(item1: &ampT, item2: &ampT) {}
</code></pre>
<p>
  The second example may actually be necessary in some cases, if you want need
  to force both input parameters to be of the same generic type.
</p>

<h3>Specifying Multiple Trait Bounds with the + Syntax</h3>
<div class="quote-wrapper">
  <blockquote>
    We can also specify more than one trait bound. Say we wanted notify to use 
    display formatting as well as summarize on item: we specify in the notify 
    definition that item must implement both Display and Summary. We can do so 
    using the + syntax:
  </blockquote>
  <a href="https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch10-02-traits.html#specifying-multiple-trait-bounds-with-the--syntax" class="quote-src">
    -- The Book: Chapter 10.2 
  </a>
</div>
<p>
  Both of the function signatures below are valid.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">pub fn notify(item: &amp(impl Summary + Display)) {
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-rust">pub fn notify&ltT: Summary + Display&gt(item: &ampT) {
</code></pre>

<h3>Clearer Trait Bounds with where Clauses</h3>
<p>
  Here's a new keyword for you... <code class="inline-code">where</code>
</p>

<div class="quote-wrapper">
  <blockquote>
    Using too many trait bounds has its downsides. Each generic has its own 
    trait bounds, so functions with multiple generic type parameters can 
    contain lots of trait bound information between the function’s name and 
    its parameter list, making the function signature hard to read. For this 
    reason, Rust has alternate syntax for specifying trait bounds inside a 
    where clause after the function signature. So, instead of writing this:
    <pre><code class="language-rust">fn some_function&ltT: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug&gt(t: &ampT, u: &ampU) -> i32 { 
    </code></pre>
    we can use a where clause, like this:
    <pre><code class="language-rust">fn some_function&ltT, U&gt(t: &ampT, u: &ampU) -&gt i32
where
    T: Display + Clone,
    U: Clone + Debug,
{
    </code></pre>

    The Book: Chapter 10.2
  </a>
</div>
<h2>Returning Types That Implement Traits</h2>
<p>
  It's also possible to return a type that implements a certain trait using
  the <code class="inline-code">impl Trait</code> syntax:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn returns_summarizable() -&gt impl Summary {
    SocialPost {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        repost: false,
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Using Trait Bounds To Conditionally Implement Methods</h3>
<div class="quote-wrapper">
  <blockquote>
    <p> 
      By using a trait bound with an impl block that uses generic type 
      parameters, we can implement methods conditionally for types that 
      implement the specified traits. For example, the type 
      <code class="inline-code">Pair&ltT&gt</code> in Listing 10-15 always 
      implements the new function to return a new instance of 
      <code class="inline-code">Pair&ltT&gt</code> (recall from the “Defining 
      Methods” section of Chapter 5 that Self is a type alias for the type of 
      the <code class="inline-code">impl</code> block, which in this case is 
      <code class="inline-code">Pair&ltT&gt</code>). But in the next impl 
      block, <code class="inline-code">Pair&ltT&gt</code> only implements the 
      <code class="inline-code">cmp_display</code> method if its inner 
      type <code class="inline-code">T</code> implements the 
      <code class="inline-code">PartialOrd</code> trait that enables comparison 
      <i>and</i> the <code class="inline-code">Display</code> trait that 
      enables printing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also conditionally implement a trait for any type that 
      implements another trait. Implementations of a trait on any type that 
      satisfies the trait bounds are called <i>blanket implementations</i> 
      and are used extensively in the Rust standard library. For example, the 
      standard library implements the <code class="inline-code">ToString</code>
      trait on any type that implements the 
      <code class="inline-code">Display</code> trait. The impl block in the 
      standard library looks similar to this code:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-rust">impl&ltT: Display&gt ToString for T {
    // --snip--
}
    </code></pre>

</div>

<h2>Lifetimes</h2>
<h3>Validating References with Lifetimes</h3>
<p>
  Lifetimes are another generic type that we've already been using. While 
  generics and traits allow us to require that a specific type has the correct
  behavior we want, <i>lifetimes</i> let us ensure that a reference is valid
  for as long as it needs to be. Most of the time, lifetimes are implicit and 
  inferred, just like most of the time, types are inferred. We are only 
  required to annotate types when multiple types are possible. In a similar 
  way, we have to annotate lifetimes when the lifetimes of references could 
  be related in a few different ways. Rust requires us to annotate the 
  relationships using generic lifetime parameters to ensure the actual 
  references used at runtime will definitely be valid.
</p>
<h2>Preventing Dangling References With Lifetimes</h2>
<p>
  The main aim of lifetimes is to prevent dangling references, which is when 
  a program references data that it's not supposed to reference. The 
  borrow checker ensures that all data outlives its references. Lifetime 
  annotations don't change how long a reference lives, rather, they describe
  the relationships of the lifetimes of multiple references to each other 
  without affecting the lifetimes.
</p>
<h2>Lifetime Annotation Syntax</h2>
<p>
  Lifetimes require an <code class="inline-code">'</code>, and are usually
  all lowercase, and very short names. Similar to generic names, that are 
  often only one letter long. The lifetime annotation comes after the 
  <code class="inline-code">&amp</code>, with a space, to separate the 
  annotation from the reference type. 
</p>
<h6>Examples:</h6>
<pre><code class="language-rust">&ampi32        // a reference
&amp'a i32     // a reference with an explicit lifetime
&amp'a mut i32 // a mutable reference with an explicit lifetime
</code></pre>
<h2>Lifetime Annotations in Function Signatures</h2>
<p>
  To use lifetime annotations in function signatures, we need to declare the 
  generic lifetime parameters inside angle brackets between the function name 
  and the parameter list, just as we did with generic type parameters.

  We want the signature to express the following constraint: the returned 
  reference will be valid as long as both the parameters are valid. This is 
  the relationship between lifetimes of the parameters and the return value. 
  We’ll name the lifetime 'a and then add it to each reference,
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">fn longest&lt'a&gt(x: &amp'a str, y: &amp'a str) -&gt &amp'a str {
    if x.len() &gt y.len() { x } else { y }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  The function signature now tells Rust that for some lifetime 'a, the 
  function takes two parameters, both of which are string slices that live at 
  least as long as lifetime 'a. The function signature also tells Rust that 
  the string slice returned from the function will live at least as long as 
  lifetime 'a. 
</p>
<h2>Lifetime Annotations in Struct Definitions</h2>
<p>
  Structs can be defined with reference types as well, but if you want to do 
  this, then you must specify a lifetime.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">struct ImportantExcerpt&lt'a&gt {
    part: &amp'a str,
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  The lifetime annotation means an instance of 
  <code class="inline-code">ImportantExcerpt</code> can’t outlive the 
  reference it holds in its part field. Take a look at the source code below.
  We're creating an instance of 
  <code class="inline-code">ImportantExcerpt</code> that holds a reference to 
  a section of text owned by <code class="inline-code">passage</code>. 
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">struct ImportantExcerpt&lt'a&gt {
    part: &amp'a str,
}

pub fn run() {
    let passage: String = String::from("In a galaxy far, far away");
    let some_words: &ampstr = passage.split(',').next().unwrap(); 
    let i = ImportantExcerpt {
        part: some_words
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  Here, we create a reference type (<code class="inline-code">&ampstr</code>), 
  and pass it to the ImportantExcerpt struct. The struct goes out of scope 
  before the owned data (Rust's drop order rules work as first in last out), 
  so the code is valid.
</p>
<h2>Lifetime Elision</h2>
<div class="quote-wrapper">
  <blockquote>
    In early versions (pre-1.0) of Rust, this code wouldn’t have compiled 
    because every reference needed an explicit lifetime. At that time, the 
    function signature would have been written like this:
    <pre><code class="language-rust">fn first_word&lt'a&gt(s: &amp'a str) -&gt &amp'a str {
    </code></pre>
    After writing a lot of Rust code, the Rust team found that Rust 
    programmers were entering the same lifetime annotations over and over in 
    particular situations. These situations were predictable and followed a 
    few deterministic patterns. The developers programmed these patterns into 
    the compiler’s code so the borrow checker could infer the lifetimes in 
    these situations and wouldn’t need explicit annotations. This piece of 
    Rust history is relevant because it’s possible that more deterministic 
    patterns will emerge and be added to the compiler. In the future, even 
    fewer lifetime annotations might be required. The patterns programmed 
    into Rust’s analysis of references are called the lifetime elision rules. 
    These aren’t rules for programmers to follow; they’re a set of particular 
    cases that the compiler will consider, and if your code fits these cases, 
    you don’t need to write the lifetimes explicitly.
  </blockquote>
  <a href="https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html#lifetime-elision" class="quote-src">
    -- The Book: Chapter 10.3
  </a>
</div>
<p>
  The compiler uses three rules to figure out the lifetimes of the references 
  when there aren’t explicit annotations. The first rule applies to input 
  lifetimes, and the second and third rules apply to output lifetimes 
</p>
<h4>Lifetime Elision Rule #1</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    The function fn foo(x: &ampi32) would get one lifetime parameter and 
    become <code class="inline-code">fn foo&lt'a&gt(x: &amp'a i32)</code>.
  </li>
  <li> 
    The function fn foo(x: &ampi32, y: &ampi32) would get two lifetime 
    parameters and become fn foo&lt'a, 'b&gt(x: &amp'a i32, y: &amp'b i32).
  </li>
  <li>
    The function 
    <code class="inline-code">fn foo(x: &ampImportantExcerpt)</code> would 
    get two lifetime parameters and become 
    <code class="inline-code">fn foo&lt'a, 'b&gt(x: &amp'a ImportantExcerpt&lt'b&gt)</code>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Lifetime Elision Rule #2</h4>
<p>
  The second rule is that, if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, 
  that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters: 
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32.
</code></pre>
<h4>Lifetime Elision Rule #3</h4>
<p>  
  The third rule is that, if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, 
  but one of them is &ampself or &ampmut self because this is a method, the 
  lifetime of self is assigned to all output lifetime parameters. This third 
  rule makes methods much nicer to read and write because fewer symbols are 
  necessary.
</p>
<h2>Lifetime Annotations in Method Definitions</h2>
<p>
  Lifetimes in method definitions depend on whether the lifetimes are related 
  to the struct fields, or the input parameters and return types themselves 
</p>
<h2>Static Lifetimes</h2>
<p>
  A static lifetime quite simply means that the data can live for the entire 
  duration of the program, and it's annotated with 
  <code class="inline-code">'static</code> 
</p>
<h2>Generic Type Parameters, Trait Bounds, and Lifetimes Together</h2>
<p>
  The code block below shows how to define generic types, trait bounds, and
  life times all in one function
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::fmt::Display;

fn longest_with_an_announcement&lt'a, T&gt(
    x: &amp'a str,
    y: &amp'a str,
    ann: T,
) -&gt &amp'a str
where
    T: Display,
{
    println!("Announcement! {ann}");
    if x.len() &gt y.len() { x } else { y }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  This is the longest function that returns the longer of two string slices. 
  But now it has an extra parameter named ann of the generic type 
  <code class="inline-code">T</code>, which can be filled in by any type that 
  implements the <code class="inline-code">Display</code> trait as specified 
  by the where clause. This extra parameter will be printed using 
  <code class="inline-code">{}</code>, which is why the Display trait bound is 
  necessary. Because lifetimes are a type of generic, the declarations of the 
  lifetime parameter <code class="inline-code">'a</code> and the generic type 
  parameter <code class="inline-code">T</code> go in the same list inside the 
  angle brackets after the function name.
</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      We covered a lot in this chapter! Now that you know about generic type 
      parameters, traits and trait bounds, and generic lifetime parameters, 
      you’re ready to write code without repetition that works in many 
      different situations. Generic type parameters let you apply the code to 
      different types. Traits and trait bounds ensure that even though the 
      types are generic, they’ll have the behavior the code needs. You 
      learned how to use lifetime annotations to ensure that this flexible 
      code won’t have any dangling references. And all of this analysis 
      happens at compile time, which doesn’t affect runtime performance!
    </p>
    <p>
      Believe it or not, there is much more to learn on the topics we 
      discussed in this chapter: Chapter 18 discusses trait objects, which 
      are another way to use traits. There are also more complex scenarios 
      involving lifetime annotations that you will only need in very advanced 
      scenarios; for those, you should read the Rust Reference. But next, 
      you’ll learn how to write tests in Rust so you can make sure your code 
      is working the way it should.
