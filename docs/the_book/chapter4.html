<h1>Understanding Ownership</h1>
<p>
  The concept of ownership is the defining feature of Rust. It's how Rust is 
  able to achieve memory safety, but it can be challening to comprehend in the 
  beginning. This is where many first time Rust developers give up.
  
  In C/C++, when you manually allocate memory for a variable/object, you have 
  to free up the memory space that the object occupies when you're finished 
  using it. Otherwise, you create a memory leak. In Rust, the borrow checker 
  is how you manage memory.
</p>

<h2>Rust's rules of ownership</h2> 
<p> 
  Ownership has 3 rules, that the Rust book recommends keeping easy access to, 
  or memorize them.
  <ul>
    <li>
      Each value in Rust has a variable that is it's owner.
    </li>
    <li>
      There can only be one owner at a time.
    </li>
    <li>
      When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped. 
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Rule 1</h3>
<i class="quote">Each value in Rust has a variable that is it's owner</i>
<p> 
  The variable s1 is the owner of the string value. We use a function to 
  calculate the length of the string without ever giving up ownership of the 
  value.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let s1: String = String::from("RUST OWNERSHIP RULE #1");
let l_of_s1: u32 = string_length(&amps1);
println!("Length of: {}", l_of_s1);
</code></pre>

<h3 id="rule-2">Rule 2</h3>
<i class="quote">There can only be one owner at a time.</i>
<p>
  Assigning a variable to the value of another variable takes away ownership 
  from the initial variable.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let s1: String = String::from("RUST OWNERSHIP RULE #2");
let s2 = s1;
println!("New owner (s2): {}", s2);
println!("S1: {}", s1);
</code></pre>

<p>
  The second <code class="inline-code">println!</code> statement in the code 
  block above will cause a compiler error, because s1 doesn't own a value 
  anymore, and has effectively been dropped. 
</p>

<h3>Rule 3</h3>
<i class="quote">
  When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
</i> 
<p>
  This applies not only to function calls, but any code block surrounded by
  curly-braces. Whether it's in an if-statement, or a nested code block with 
  no entry condition, like below
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">{
    let inner_string: String = String::from("INNER SCOPE");
    println!("Nested code block message: {}", inner_string);
}
println!("This line will make the compiler angry: {}", inner_string);
</code></pre>
<p>
  The last line in the code block above would cause a compiler error, because 
  <code class="inline-code">test_string</code> was dropped after the first 
  <code class="inline-code">println!</code> statement. 
</p>

<h2>Ownership as a Discipline for Memory Safety</h2>
<h3>Operations on Memory</h3>
<p>Take a look at the snip below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let y: u8 = 0;
if y {
    println!("Yo!");
}
</code></pre>

<p>
  Rust doesn’t specify what happens if you try to run 
  <code class="inline-code">if y { .. }</code>, because Rust requires a 
  boolean value to evalute if-else branches. That behavior, or what happens 
  after executing the instruction, is undefined. Undefined behavior is 
  dangerous. In a language like C++, a few different things could happen:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The code executes without crashing, and no one notices a problem.
    </li>
    <li>
      The code immediately crashes due to a segmentation fault or another kind 
      of operating system error.
    </li>
    <li>
      The code executes without crashing, until a malicious actor creates the 
      right input to delete your production database, overwrite your backups, 
      and steal your lunch money.
    </li>
  </ul>
<p> 
  A foundational goal of Rust is to ensure that your programs never have 
  undefined behavior. That is the meaning of “safety.” Undefined behavior is 
  especially dangerous for low-level programs with direct access to memory. 
  About 70% of reported security vulnerabilities in low-level systems are caused 
  by memory corruption, which is one form of undefined behavior.
</p>
<p> 
  Memory is the space where data is stored during the execution of a program.
  There are many ways to think about memory:
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you are unfamiliar with systems programming, you might think of memory 
      at a high level like “memory is the RAM in my computer” or “memory is the 
      thing that runs out if I load too much data”.
    </li> 
    <li>
      If you are familiar with systems programming, you might think of memory 
      at a low level like “memory is an array of bytes” or “memory is the 
      pointers I get back from malloc”.
    </li>  
  </ul> 
</p>

<h4>Allocating to the heap</h4>
<p>
  Variables live in the Stack, and "boxes" live in the heap. To transfer access 
  to data without copying it, Rust uses pointers. A pointer is a value that 
  describes a location in memory. The value that a pointer points-to is called 
  its pointee. One common way to make a pointer is to allocate memory in the 
  heap.
</p>

<p>
  The heap is a separate region of memory where data can live indefinitely. 
  Heap data is not tied to a specific stack frame. Rust provides a construct 
  called <strong>Box</strong> for putting data on the heap. For example, we 
  can wrap the million-element array in 
  <code class="inline-code">Box::new</code> like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let a = Box::new([0; 1_000_000]);
let b = a;
</code></pre>

<p>
  <strong>Q:</strong> Which of the following best describes the difference 
  between the stack and the heap?
</p>
<p> 
  <strong>A:</strong> The stack holds data associated with a specific function,
  while the heap holds data that can outlive a function
</p>

<h4>Rust Does Not Permit Manual Memory Management</h4>
<p>
  Stack frames are automatically managed by Rust. When a function is called, 
  Rust allocates a stack frame for the called function. When the call ends, Rust 
  deallocates the stack frame.
</p>

<h4>Collections Use Boxes</h4>
<p>
  Boxes are used by Rust data structures like Vec, String, and HashMap to hold 
  a variable number of elements. For example, here’s a program that creates, 
  moves, and mutates a string:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let first = String::from("Ferris");  // L1
    let full = add_suffix(first);        // L2
    println!("{full}");
}

fn add_suffix(mut name: String) -> String {
    name.push_str(" Jr.");  // L3
    name                    // L4
}
</code></pre>

<p>
  This program is more involved, so make sure you follow each step:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    At L1, the string “Ferris” has been allocated on the heap. It is owned 
    by first.
  </li>
  <li>
    At L2, the function add_suffix(first) has been called. This moves 
    ownership of the string from first to name. The string data is not 
    copied, but the pointer to the data is copied.
  </li>
  <li> 
    At L3, the function name.push_str(" Jr.") resizes the string’s heap 
    allocation. This does three things. First, it creates a new larger 
    allocation. Second, it writes “Ferris Jr.” into the new allocation. Third, 
    it frees the original heap memory, and now `first` points to deallocated 
    memory.
  </li>
  <li> 
    At L4, the frame for add_suffix is gone. This function returned name, 
    transferring ownership of the string to full.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Variables Cannot Be Used After Being Moved</h4>
<p>
  The string program helps illustrate a key safety principle for ownership. 
  Imagine that first were used in main after calling add_suffix. We can 
  simulate such a program and see the undefined behavior that results.
</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts On Borrowing and Referencing</h2>
<p>
  Technically speaking, borrowing and referencing are the same things. You 
  create a <strong>reference</strong> <i>by</i> <strong>borrowing</strong>. 
  References can be either mutable, or immutable. A mutable reference allows 
  you to modify the original data.
</p> 
<p>
  Simple data types can be <i>copy types</i> which means that you can't change 
  ownership by reassigning like you do with strings. Instead, a new variable is 
  created entirely.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let agro_level: u8 = 200;
let mut health = agro_level;
health -= 10;
println!("Health: {}\nAgro: {}", health, agro_level);

// To create a mutable reference of an integer, which modifies
// the original value also, you have to declare both variables
// as mutable types. 
let mut x: u32 = 29;
let y: &ampmut u32 = &ampmut x;
*y += 71; 
println!("x: {}", x);  // Output's 100
</code></pre>

<p>
  There are at least 4 ways to work with referenced data in Rust, which is to
  <strong>move, copy, borrow,</strong> and <strong>borrow mutably</strong>
</p>

<h3>Move</h3>
<p>
  A <strong>move</strong> happens when you pass something that is not a copy 
  type into another function. When the value is passed, the function now owns 
  the value. If the function does not return the value, then the value is 
  freed from memory after the function has consumed it. See ownership 
  <a href="#rule-2">rule #2</a> for another way to move.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">fn use_string(s: String) {
    println!("This string: {}", s); 
    // s is freed from memory, here
}

fn main() {
    let string = String::new();
    use_string(string);  // <- Ownership moved here.
//  println!("{}", string);
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  The commented line above would cause a compiler error, because ownership
  of <code class="inline-code">string</code> was transferred without being 
  returned, and thus, freed from memory when the 
  <code class="inline-code">use_string()</code> function was called.
</p>

<h3>Copy</h3>
<p>
  Some stack-allocated data types implement the 'Copy' trait, which means that 
  the values are copied rather than having their ownership moved. This works 
  fine for data types that take up small amounts of memory, such as integers.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">fn use_int(n: u32) {
    println!("This value: {}", n); 
}

fn main() {
    let num: u32 = 32;
    use_int(num);
    println!("{}", num);
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  Unlike the example in the <i>Move</i> section, no error is thrown when 
  accessing num after the call to <code class="inline-code">use_int()</code>.
  Even the largest integers need only 16 bytes to be able to store their 
  value in memory, but that would hardly be enough to store the first and 
  last name of some people, much less large pieces of text. This is where 
  borrowing comes in.
</p>

<h3>Borrow</h3>
<p>
  Borrowing in Rust allows you to reference an existing string without taking
  ownership of it.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">fn use_string(s: &ampstr) {
    println!("This string: {}", s); 
}

fn main() {
    let string = String::new();
    use_string(&ampstring);    // <- Borrow occurs here, no ownership transfer 
    println!("{}", string); // <- Line doesn't crash, like in 'Move' example 
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Borrow mutably</h3>
<p>
  Borrowing mutably allows you to borrow a value, mutate the original value, 
  then return ownershship. Continuing with the same example from earlier:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">fn add_sleep(sleep_str: &ampmut String) {
    sleep_str.push_str("z"); 
}

fn main() {
    let mut sleep_str: String = String::from("Z");
    for _ in 0..15 {
        // Mutable reference is passed in, and the string is still accessible
        // after the add_sleep function call
        add_sleep(&ampmut sleep_str);
    }
    println!("Sleeping: {}", sleep_str);
}
</code></pre>
<p>
  The mutable string is borrowed and passed into the `add_sleep()` function 
  in the for-loop. If we passed in the string itself, it would be dropped at 
  the end of the function. By passing in a mutable reference, we're able to 
  mutate the source data on each loop iteration, dropping the reference after 
  the mutation, and maintain access to the original object after the function 
  call.
</p>

<h2>Dereferencing</h2>
<p> 
  Examples using boxes and strings have not shown how Rust “follows” a pointer 
  to its data. For example, the println! macro has mysteriously worked for both 
  owned strings of type String, and for string references of type &String. The 
  underlying mechanism is the dereference operator, written with an asterisk 
  (*)
</p>
<p>
  Dereferencing works the same way that it does in C. Dereferencing happens 
  implicitly a lot of times in Rust, but is necessary to do manually on 
  occassion. In the sample below, we create a reference to <strong>_x</strong>
  as <strong>_r</strong>, then attempt to append _x with the value of _r. 
  Since _r is only a reference, we need to <i>dereference</i> it in order to 
  access the value stored in it. This is done prefixing a single 
  <code class="inline-code">*</code> onto the variable name. 
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">let mut _x: i32 = 5;
let _r: &ampi32 = &_x;
_x += *_r;
println!("_x: {}", _x);
</code></pre>

<p>
  Here's another example using strings. You can't borrow an immutable string 
  from an already borrowed mutable string, so we have to clone the borrowed 
  string and pass in a reference to the clone in order to actually double the 
  string.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">pub fn double_string(string: &ampmut String) {
    string.push_str(&ampstring.clone());
}
</code></pre>

The snippet below demonstrates how dereferencing works when it's on either
side of an assignment.

<pre><code class="language-rust">let mut x: Box&lti32&gt = Box::new(1);
let a: i32 = *x;         // *x reads the heap value, so a = 1
*x += 1;                 // *x on the left-side modifies the heap value,
                         //     so x points to the value 2

let r1: &ampBox&lgti32&gt = &ampx;    // r1 points to x on the stack
let b: i32 = **r1;       // two dereferences get us to the heap value

let r2: &ampi32 = &*x;      // r2 points to the heap value directly
let c: i32 = *r2;        // so only one dereference is needed to read it
</code></pre>

<p>
  You probably won’t see the dereference operator very often when you read Rust 
  code. Rust implicitly inserts dereferences and references in certain cases, 
  such as calling a method with the dot operator
</p>

<hr>
<h2>4.4 The Slice Type</h2>
<p>
  A slice is a type of reference, so it's a non-owning pointer. 
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let s = String::from("hello world");

let hello: &ampstr = &amps[0..5];
let world: &ampstr = &amps[6..11];
let s2: &ampString = &amps;
</code></pre>
<p>
  Slices are special kinds of references because they are “fat” pointers, or 
  pointers with metadata. Here, the metadata is the length of the slice.
</p>

<h3>String Literals Are Slices</h3>
<p>
  Recall that we talked about string literals being stored inside the binary. 
  Now that we know about slices, we can properly understand string literals:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let s = "Hello, world!";</code></pre>
<p>
  The type of <code class="inline-code">s</code> here is 
  <code class="inline-code">&ampstr</code>: it’s a slice pointing to that 
  specific point of the binary. This is also why string literals are immutable;
  <code class="inline-code">&ampstr</code> is an immutable reference.
</p>
<h3>Other Slices</h3>
<p>
  String slices, as you might imagine, are specific to strings. But there’s a 
  more general slice type, too. Consider this array:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];</code></pre>

<p>
  Just as we might want to refer to a part of a string, we might want to refer 
  to part of an array. We’d do so like this:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let slice = &ampa[1..3];
assert_eq!(slice, &amp[2, 3]);
</code></pre>

<p>
  This slice has the type <code class="inline-code">&amp[i32]</code>. 
  It works the same way as string slices do, by storing a reference to the 
  first element and a length. You’ll use this kind of slice for all sorts of 
  other collections. We’ll discuss these collections in detail when we talk 
  about vectors in Chapter 8.
</p>
