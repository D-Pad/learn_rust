<h1>Rust Basics</h1> 
<p>
  This chapter starts showing some basics of the Rust programming language 
  by having the user program a guessing game. Lessons in this chapter include
  using the 
  <code class="inline-code">let</code>, and 
  <code class="inline-code">match</code>
  key words, methods, associated functions, and
  external crates.
  
  The book creates a new crate called "guessing_game", but we're just going to 
  create a module instead, since that's follows the format of this 
  documentation. For this excercize, we're going to have to use the standard 
  library's 
  <code>io</code>
  module.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::io;</code></pre>
<p>
  By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it 
  brings into the scope of every program. This set is called the prelude, and 
  you can see everything in it in the standard library
  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html">documentation</a>
</p>

<p>
  Begin by declaring a mutable String variable.
  <pre><code class="language-rust">let mut guess: String = String::new();</code></pre>
  Then prompt the user to input a guess.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">io::stdin().read_line(&ampmut guess).expect("Failed to read line");
</code></pre>

<p>
  We'll use the Result enum in this example. Enumerators are a topic for a later
  time, but for now, know that Results has 2 possible states, which are `Ok`, 
  and `Err`. This is uses for error handling.
</p>

<h2>The guessing game</h2>
<p>
  Check the source code for the full code block. Below, we'll highlight some of
  the unique bits, starting with the random number generation. Use the `rand`
  crate to get tools that generate random numbers.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use rand::Rng;
// Generate a random number
let x: u8 = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
</code></pre>
<p>
  Mutating a string by passing it into `read_line` appends new data on every
  loop. We could reset the string data to "" on each loop, but we may as well
  just declare the string inside the loop on each iteration rather than trying
  to declare it in a higher scope than the loop.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">loop {        
    
    // Declare a string
    let mut guess: String = String::new();
    
    // Get user input
    let _ = io::stdin()
        .read_line(&ampmut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");
</code></pre>
<p>
  The guess in the expression refers to the original guess variable that 
  contained the input as a string. The trim method on a String instance will 
  eliminate any whitespace at the beginning and end, which we must do to be able 
  to compare the string to the `u32`, which can only contain *numerical data*. 
  The user must press `enter` to satisfy `read_line` and input their guess, 
  which adds a newline character to the string. For example, if the user types
  <code class="inline-code">5</code> and presses 
  <code class="inline-code">enter</code>, guess looks like this: 
  <code class="inline-code">5\n</code> 
  
  <pre><code class="language-rust">let guess: u8 = guess
  .trim()
  .parse()
  .expect("Please type a number");</code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  Use the cmp module to compare values, and use the Ordering enum to react
  to the comparison. The full code for the guessing game is listed below.
</p>
<h3>Full Source Code:</h3>
<pre><code class="language-rust">use std::io;
use std::cmp::Ordering;
use rand::Rng;


pub fn run() {
   

    // Initial variables 
    const MAX_GUESS_COUNT: u8 = 8;
    println!("\nRust guessing game!");

    // Generate a random number
    let x: u8 = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);

    // Check the answer
    let mut guess_count: u8 = 0;
    loop {        
        
        // Get user input
        println!("\nGuess a number between 1 and 100:");
        let mut guess: String = String::new();
        let _ = io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
        
        // Clean the string input for integer conversion
        let guess: u8 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => 0, 
        };

        // Check the guess
        if guess > 0 {
            match guess.cmp(&x) {
                Ordering::Less => println!("\nToo small..."),
                Ordering::Greater => println!("\nToo big..."),
                Ordering::Equal => {
                    println!("\nYou got it in {} tries", guess_count + 1);
                    break;
                }
            }
        } else {
            println!("\nInvalid input");
        }

        // Break if the guess count exceeds 3
        guess_count += 1;
        if guess_count == MAX_GUESS_COUNT {
            println!("No more guesses. You lose.");
            println!("The answer was: {x}");
            break;
        }
    }
}
